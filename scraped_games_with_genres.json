At the time, Halo was going to be a simultaneous Mac and Windows release. Prior to MacWorld Halo had only been viewed behind closed doors by journalists who were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. At this point Halo was intended to be a third-person-action game, in which a ship crash lands on a ring world and early versions of the <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">Covenant</a> aliens appear simply to loot what they can with the humans forced to resort to guerrilla warfare.</p><p>The first official trailer was shown at E3 2000 and was well received. One month later on June 19th 2000 Microsoft announced that it had acquired Bungie Studios; Halo had become an Xbox exclusive. Bungie rewrote the game's engine and the game became a first person shooter. Playable demos carried mixed reactions up to its release simultaneously with the Xbox on November 15th, 2001.</p><h3>Remake</h3><p>At E3 2011, it was announced that on November 15th, 2011, exactly ten years after the release of the original Halo game, which went on to spawn one of the most popular video-game franchises of all time, the new holders of the legal rights to the franchise would be releasing a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved for the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>, featuring an identical game engine but bleeding-edge graphics layered over it. Released as a slightly budget-priced remake the game was entitled Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Backstory / The Pillar of Autumn</h3><p>The plot of Halo: Combat Evolved begins in the year 2525. Humans, under the United Nations Space Command ( <a href=\"/unsc/3015-3859/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC</a>) have harnessed faster-than-light \"Slipspace\" travel and have colonized hundreds of planets in solar systems across the galaxy. During the Human expansion, they encounter an alliance of alien species, called <a href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">the Covenant</a>, who are inexplicably intent on the complete eradication of Humankind from the galaxy. Fortunately, the UNSC had previously created a <a href=\"/super-soldier/3015-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-90\">supersoldier</a> program to deal with terrorists, labelling the genetically-modified subjects \" <a href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">Spartans</a>,\" and equipping the super soldiers with a suit of power armour made of the most cutting edge technology available, that was soon made even more formidable with the addition of <a href=\"/energy-force-shield/3055-644/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-644\">energy shields</a> based on stolen Covenant technology.</p><p>In August of 2552, the Covenant find the planet <a href=\"/reach/3035-571/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-571\">Reach</a>, a major Human military stronghold, the second-most well protected planet after Earth herself, and assault the planet with a massive fleet. Reach falls, and most of the Spartans are lost in the battle. One, however, Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, commonly known as simply \" <a href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-175\">the Master Chief</a>,\" escapes aboard the UNSC <a href=\"/pillar-of-autumn/3055-1835/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1835\">Pillar of Autumn</a>, a Halcyon-class battlecruiser, that flees into Slipspace away from Reach at a supposedly random vector. The Pillar of Autumn falls out of Slipspace several weeks later in an unknown quadrant of space, unable to contact any other UNSC forces. There, they find a massive artificial installation, shaped like a perfectly round ring, orbiting a gas giant. <a href=\"/cortana/3005-315/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-315\">Cortana</a>, the ship's onboard AI, notes to Captain <a href=\"/jacob-keyes/3005-1580/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1580\">Jacob Keyes</a> that the ring's inner concave features a terraformed landscape similar to most terrestrial planets, and even has atmosphere and gravity levels comparable to that of Earth.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345405\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345405\"><img alt=\"The Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 1600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345405-pillar_of_autumn.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Pillar of Autumn</figcaption></figure><p>Within moments of exiting Slipspace and finding the ring, the Pillar of Autumn is located by a Covenant starship, which was already in the vicinity of the ringworld when they arrived. The Covenant, however, withhold bombarding the Autumn with plasma weapons so close to the ring, and instead deploy infantry to board the cruiser. Just before the Covenant's arrival on-board, the Master Chief is awakened from cryo-sleep, from which he makes his way to the bridge, where Captain Keyes gives him his pistol. Keyes's plan is to crash-land the Autumn on the habitable ringworld. Before leaving, the Master Chief takes the chip that contains Cortana and inserts the chip into his MJOLNIR suit in order to prevent her from falling into Covenant hands. Together, the Master Chief and Cortana make their way through the quickly-deteriorating Autumn, toward the ship's escape pods, where the remaining marines on-board have prepared for evacuation. The Master Chief enters a escape pod, and it jettisons from the Pillar of Autumn as the cruiser careens into the atmosphere of the ring.</p><h3>Halo / Truth and Reconciliation / The Silent Cartographer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\"><img alt=\"Halo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo</figcaption></figure><p>The Master Chief's escape pod crash-lands onto the ring, killing all the marines within and knocking the Master Chief unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the Master Chief learns that other pods have landed safely within the vicinity and Cortana intercepts Covenant chatter revealing that the Covenant have seized the wreckage of the Autumn and have captured Captain Keyes himself, holding him prisoner aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Collecting what is left of the UNSC Marines, the Master Chief, <a href=\"/sergeant-major-avery-junior-johnson/3005-964/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-964\">Sergeant Avery Johnson</a>, and dropship pilot Carol Rawley (known in-game by her callsign \"Foe Hammer\") make a push for the Truth and Reconciliation, where they plan to rescue Keyes from capture. Upon meeting up with him again, Captain Keyes reveals that he has learned through eavesdropping on his captor's conversations that the Covenant call the ringworld \" <a href=\"/halo/3035-58/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo</a>,\" and that they deem it not only as a religious relic, but as a powerful superweapon, one with enough influence to give its manipulator the power to control the galaxy. Cortana remarks she had intercepted several transmissions referring to a \"control room,\" and that she assumed the Covenant were looking for a control room to a cruiser damaged in the battle above the ring. Instead, the Covenant are actually looking for Halo's control center. Cortana believes that the Humans can get there first if she can interface with a local mapping station referred to by the Covenant as the \"Silent Cartographer\".</p><p>Committed to stopping the Covenant before they find the Control Room, and reinvigorated after the successful invasion of the Truth and Reconciliation, the marines on Halo begin a large-scale assault for the Silent Cartographer. In the meantime, Keyes gains information regarding the location of a large Covenant weapons cache. Believing he and a group of marines led by Sergeant Johnson can seize the cache, he leaves to make his way there, without the Master Chief, who is sent to find and operate the Silent Cartographer. The Chief is successful in this mission, and learns the location of the Control Room, as Keyes and Johnson close in on the weapons cache, deep inside a dense jungle several hundred miles away from the Cartographer island.</p><h3>Assault on the Control Room / 343 Guilty Spark</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\"><img alt=\"Assault on the Control Room\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Assault on the Control Room\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345421-4wiki.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Assault on the Control Room</figcaption></figure><p>Foe Hammer brings the Master Chief and Cortana as close as she can to the Control Room, where the Master Chief makes a push through heavy Covenant resistance--the heaviest yet seen on Halo--for the Control Room, which is a vast chamber with a holographic Halo rotating around the perimeter and central platform. Upon reaching the Control Room (and locking the Covenant out of it), the Master Chief removes Cortana's chip and uploads her into the terminal. She exclaims that the wealth of information is nearly intoxicating, even for an AI like herself, and mentions that an ancient alien race called the <a href=\"/the-forerunner/3015-80/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunners</a> built an array of Halos just like this one, millions of years ago. And as she uncovers this information, she stops abruptly. Horrified by something unknown to the Master Chief, she orders him to find Keyes and to stop him from opening the weapons cache \"before it is too late.\"</p><p>Leaving Cortana in the locked Control Room, the Master Chief and Foe Hammer hurry for the jungle. Once in the jungle, beneath the fog and foliage canopy, the Chief finds corpses of Covenant soldiers-- <a href=\"/grunts/3015-1331/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1331\">Grunts</a>, <a href=\"/jackals/3015-3379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3379\">Jackals</a>, and even <a href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites</a>--and an abandoned <a href=\"/pelican/3055-1038/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1038\">Pelican</a> dropship playing a looping distress message. Traversing the jungle, the Master Chief finds a facility nestled into the side of a bluff--the cache Keyes came to find. Inside the facility, the Chief finds little trace of Captain Keyes, Johnson, or the marines amongst the scattered and panicked Covenant troops and Covenant corpses, but finds massive amounts of alien blood splattering the walls, far more than would be created by being shot by Human weapons. Later, he comes across a single marine who appears to have lost his mind, shooting at anything that moves and telling \"those things\" to stay away from him, and that he won't let them get him. Deep within the facility, the Master Chief finds a heavy blast door locked from the outside by a UNSC tech-lock. Activating it, the Master Chief opens the door and finds a marine corpse slumped against the door. Another marine's helmet lies nearby on the ground, next to a large pool of blood. The Master Chief links up with the video feed from the missing marine's helmet, which shows Keyes and Johnson investigating the cache before being ambushed by a new, unidentified non-Covenant alien species. The video feed shows Keyes's group completely overrun by the pulpy creatures before the video ends abruptly, citing the marine's death as the cause for disruption.</p><p>Moments after viewing the feed, the Master Chief is ambushed by a massive swarm of the small, pulpy aliens, now accompanied by larger Combat Forms. The Combat Forms resemble--and, indeed, are--rotting Covenant and Human corpses, now under the control of the smaller Infection Forms. Fighting his way out to the jungle, killing both former enemies and allies now controlled by the parasite, the Master Chief exits the facility on the far side of the bluff, and is assisted by a number of airborne robots of unknown origin, armed with powerful laser weaponry that seems to be perfectly designed to destroy the mutated creatures. The leader of the robots (which are known as Sentinels) teleports the Master Chief to a raised position atop a gigantic tower, and introduces himself as <a href=\"/343-guilty-spark/3005-1190/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1190\">343 Guilty Spark</a>, the Monitor of Installation Zero-Four (the Forerunner term for this specific Halo, as there are seven total). Spark exclaims that someone--the Covenant, who he calls an impatient and overzealous group of aliens--has released <a href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">the Flood</a>, the parasitic lifeform now rampant upon the soil of Halo. Calling the Master Chief a \"Reclaimer,\" the Monitor states the only way to stop the Flood is to activate Halo itself, a task for which they require the Index, a Forerunner tech-key located within a tower called the Library.</p><h3>The Library / Two Betrayals</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\"><img alt=\"Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"</figcaption></figure><p>The Monitor escorts the Master Chief through myriad waves of Flood Combat Forms, commenting that that the Chief's weapons are highly ineffective against the Flood, and makes several comments regarding the Master Chief's lack of preparedness for Flood containment protocols. On the way, Guilty Spark mentions that the Flood are contained on Halo for study, and that, in the case that the Flood escape Halo, they would consume all sentient life in the galaxy. Once at the Index, the Monitor absorbs the key's data, and teleports both himself and the Master Chief back to the Control Room.</p><p>When the pair arrive at Halo's Control Room, Cortana reappears in the terminal just as the Master Chief inserts the Index to activate the ring's weaponry. She impedes the process and uses her command of the ringworld's systems to temporarily disable the Monitor. Cortana derides the Master Chief for falling in step with Spark without knowing the full capability of Halo's power. \"Halo doesn't kill the Flood,\" Cortana explains, \"it kills their food. Human, Covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible.\"</p><p>The Chief questions the Monitor, who seems strangely confused that the Master Chief was ignorant to this knowledge--as though he should have known this before. When Cortana absorbs the Index's data and is reinserted into the MJOLNIR armor, the Monitor summons a squad of Sentinels to attack the Master Chief, who now fights a war on three fronts--Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels. Cortana and the Master Chief escape, and Cortana--having completely assimilated the vast breadth of Halo's information--tells the Master Chief that the only way to guarantee Halo cannot be fired, which would trigger the rest of the rings in the array and thus destroy all sentient life in the galaxy, is to destroy it entirely, and that the only way to destroy Halo is to detonate the fusion core inside the wreckage of the Pillar of Autumn, and that the only way to detonate the Autumn's core is with a special set of passcodes contained in a chip implanted in the brain of Captain Keyes. Therefore, he must be rescued at all costs.</p><p>The Master Chief destroys the three generators powering the majority of Halo's central functions, buying enough time for Cortana to find Keyes before the Monitor can reboot the ring's arsenal. With that done, she determines that Keyes--alive or dead--is on-board the now Flood-controlled Truth and Reconciliation.</p><h3>Keyes / The Maw</h3><p>Cortana manages to transport them to the Truth and Reconciliation via a teleportation tactic similar to that which the Monitor uses. Immediately, Keyes, sounding pained and on the verge of death, radios the Master Chief to turn back, to leave Halo by any means possible. The Flood, having completely overrun the ship, gather piles of Covenant corpses in the two largest rooms for some unknown purpose (later entries in the series imply that this was in preparation for the construction of a <a href=\"/gravemind/3005-996/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-996\">Gravemind</a>). And as the Chief makes his way toward Keyes, he learns that the Flood are repairing the Truth and Reconciliation, planning to leave Halo in order to consume more sentient life. The Chief finds Keyes, but finds him too late. Keyes is totally consumed by the Flood and has been absorbed into a large, fleshy growth of Flood tissue. Cortana remarks that Keyes wanted them to leave by any means possible, and the Master Chief obliges, punching his hand into the softened skull of the deceased captain, physically removing the chip from within. Black-armored Covenant special operatives arrive on the ship to thwart the Flood threat, and they are distraction enough for the Master Chief to hijack a Covenant <a href=\"/banshee/3055-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee</a> and escape the Truth and Reconciliation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\"><img alt=\"The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60997/1738248-crashlanding.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn</figcaption></figure><p>As the sun rises on Halo, the Master Chief's Banshee reaches the Autumn, which has already been occupied by Flood and Sentinel forces since the Flood incursion. At the Autumn's bridge, Cortana uses Keyes's chip to activate the self-destruct sequence, but it is stopped by the Monitor, who has taken full control of the ship's remaining functional systems. Although Cortana has finally run out of ideas, the Chief suggests they do it the old fashioned way: damage the fusion core using grenades or rockets, rendering it unstable to the point where detonation becomes inevitable.</p><p>The Master Chief fights through waves of Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels, all assaulting each other as well as the lone Spartan, who appears to be one of the only Humans left alive on Halo. After detonating the four reactors, the Chief successfully damages the fusion core and starts the inevitable chain reaction. Foe Hammer, having survived the Flood infection in her Pelican, tells the Master Chief to grab a Warthog from the vehicle depot and meet her at a landing pad just under a kilometer down the length of the ship, where she can extract him and Cortana and escape the destruction of Halo. Driving over Flood forms and dodging Sentinel laser cannons and Covenant plasma fire, the Chief makes it to the landing pad with minutes to spare, but Foe Hammer is ambushed by a pair of Covenant Banshees, and her Pelican crashes and explodes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\"><img alt=\"The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4586/1345429-scrn_006.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"</figcaption></figure><p>With no time to mourn their most recently slain friend, the Master Chief and Cortana make one final charge: a Longsword starfighter is docked at the far end of the ship, and if they can make it there in time, they can use it to escape Halo. Seconds before the Autumn detonates, the Chief boards the Longsword and flees the ring, managing to get to a safe distance just before the nuclear reaction creates a shockwave whose power is enough to shatter Halo entirely, sending massive, concave shards careening through space. The Chief uses the Longsword's sensors to search the debris field, hoping that other UNSC marines escaped the ring before its destruction.

It differs from most others at the time in the damage system, where it has the standard health bar with eight bars which decrease when hit after the shields have failed (can be replenished with health packs). As opposed to picking up an \"armor power up\" the player always has shields which slowly take damage when hit like a secondary health bar, if hit enough they fail and health begins to decrease, and if the player keeps their head down long enough they recharge. Halo made this style of health regeneration popular within many games made today, and this reason is one of many of why Halo was so revolutionary. Along with popularizing health regeneration Halo also popularized restricting the player to only carrying two weapons at a time, simultaneously solving the problem of cycling through large numbers of weapons on a console pad and forcing developers to make every weapon \"count\", as the pistol could no longer be a near-useless weapon of last resort, for example. It is also remembered for its extremely tight controls which made it the first great feeling FPS, on the console.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204106\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204106\"><img alt=\"SPNKr Rocket Launcher\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SPNKr Rocket Launcher\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1326/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>SPNKr Rocket Launcher</figcaption></figure><p>The weapons are separated into two categories, Covenant and Human. The Human side is fairly standard, with futuristic looking versions of the classics ( <a href=\"/ma5c-assault-rifle/3055-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-116\">assault rifle</a>, <a href=\"/m90-shotgun/3055-127/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-127\">shotgun</a>, <a href=\"/srs99d-sniper-rifle/3055-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-113\">sniper</a>, etc.). The Covenant technology is all energy based weaponry that fires charged bolts of plasma, or needles/crystals.

The <a href=\"/needler/3055-135/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">needler</a> uses crystals to hit and stick to the enemy doing average damage, but when many are stuck to the target simultaneously, it causes them to explode causing heavy damage.

It also inherited the Bungie fan community that already existed and gained many new fans due to its fantastic campaign mode and multiplayer matches. By connecting up to 4 Xbox consoles through System Link (with Ethernet cables and a router if necessary) Halo LAN parties made Halo: Combat Evolved a phenomenon. Players could play up to 16 player multiplayer matches while all being in the same location to trash talk and berate each other. A year after release Halo: Combat Evolved was already being played competitively in tournaments and online using legal tunneling software such as <a href=\"http://www.xbconnect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox Connect</a>.

Many custom levels have been created by dedicated members of the modding community and have been posted for download at a large number of websites.</p><p>Custom Edition's Halo Editing Kit let people create many things including:</p><ul><li>Level geometry</li><li>Bitmaps</li><li>Player Character</li><li>Weapons</li><li>Vehicles</li><li>Sounds</li><li>Game Interfaces</li><li>Level Scripts and Interactivity</li><li>Objects</li><li>Special Effects</li><li>Animations</li><li>Single Player Modifications</li><li>HUDS</li></ul><h2>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1804564\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56037735849057\" data-width=\"530\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 530px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1804564\"><img alt=\"Halo, now remastered in HD\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg 530w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Halo, now remastered in HD\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg 530w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30760/1804564-halo_anniversary_ring.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Halo, now remastered in HD</figcaption></figure><p>Developed by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/343-industries/3010-6753/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6753\">343 Industries</a> (in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/saber-interactive/3010-2282/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2282\">Saber</a> for the campaign and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/certain-affinity/3010-6279/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6279\">Certain Affinity</a> for the multiplayer) and published by Microsoft for the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> on November 15, 2011, Halo CE Anniversary was released on the tenth anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo</a> franchise.

It follows the original <a href=\"/azure-striker-gunvolt/3030-45605/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45605\">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a>, first released in 2014. After defeating the Sumeragi Group in the previous game, the eponymous hero Gunvolt takes some time to rest and recuperate before the world is threatened again by the mysterious Eden organization.</p><p>In addition to Gunvolt, the character of <a href=\"/copen/3005-30965/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-30965\">Copen</a> - Gunvolt's rival - is now playable. His campaign and play style is distinct from Gunvolt's. </p><p>The game was originally released for 3DS and eventually ported to the Nintendo Switch. The North American publisher of the retail version is <a href=\"/yacht-club-games/3010-8654/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8654\">Yacht Club Games</a>, the developers of Shovel Knight.

His only method of attack is shooting projectiles straight forward. The structure follows a typical <a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">metroidvania</a> style format, with multiple paths to take within a large area rather than completely separate levels. There are also several upgrades to be obtained throughout the game.</p><p>Sivak released a demo for BK:FoP shortly before the game's release.

Timber's parents have gone on vacation and left him in charge of the usually peaceful island they live on. However, unfortunately for Timber and his friends, an evil pig <a href=\"/wizards/3015-1694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1694\">wizard</a> from outer <a href=\"/space/3035-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-50\">space</a> called <a href=\"/wizpig/3005-2457/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2457\">Wizpig</a> has dropped in to ruin Timber's fun. Wizpig wants to take over <a href=\"/timbers-island/3035-2063/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2063\">Timber's Island</a> and claim it as his own by conquering all of the island's race tracks, as he has done on his home planet Future Fun Land. Hearing the news, Diddy Kong recruits his friends <a href=\"/banjo/3005-63/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-63\">Banjo the bear</a> and <a href=\"/conker/3005-316/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-316\">Conker the squirrel</a> (this game is actually the first appearance of Conker and Banjo, though <a href=\"/kazooie/3005-213/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-213\">Kazooie</a> had yet to be created) and heads over to Timber's Island whilst Timber enlists the remaining inhabitants of the island. They then join forces to go up against the evil Wizpig.

He also turned veteran racer Drumstick into a frog that looks just a little bit like a rooster. Diddy and his friends must race against Wizpig and his friends and complete all of their challenges to prevent Wizpig taking over the island for good.

A golden balloon is awarded after each race won and the player must collect a certain number of golden balloons to progress to the next stage. Some golden balloons can be found in the hub world that connects the game's areas. Diddy and his friends must eventually defeat Wizpig in a race, causing him to flee back to his home planet Future Fun Land. Uncertain that Wizpig won't return to try and take over the island again the characters follow him to his home planet for the final showdown where victory blasts Wizpig off on a rocket into distant space never to be seen again.</p><h3>Silver Coin Challenges</h3><p>In order to extend the length of the game (and add more difficulty) after beating races the first time, the player must go and complete Silver Coin Challenges. These take place on the same tracks, but the player must collect eight Silver Coins hidden throughout the tracks, <i>and</i> win. Of course these coins are not simply sitting in the middle of the track, and many involve going well out of the way to collect.</p><h3>Mirror Mode</h3><p>Completing Adventure Mode once unlocks a new mode where all of the courses in the game are mirrored, and the player must complete them all again.

It was released on November 17, 2001 in North America; on September 14, 2001 in Japan; and on May 3, 2002 in Europe. Luigi's Mansion was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo. It focuses on <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a>'s mission to clear a haunted mansion, that he 'won' in a contest he didn't enter, of ghosts to save Mario from their clutches. To do so, he hooks up with <a href=\"/professor-e-gadd/3005-1776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1776\">Professor E. Gadd</a>, who gives him a special vacuum, called the \" <a href=\"/poltergust-3000/3055-599/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-599\">Poltergust 3000</a>\", and a special Game Boy, called the <a href=\"/game-boy-horror/3055-1266/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1266\">Game Boy Horror</a>, to help with the job.</p><p>Despite its short length, Luigi's Mansion was received relatively well, and sold over 2.5 million copies. Due to this, Luigi's Mansion was later released as a Player's Choice title (and was one of the first title to be granted this status).</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Luigi's Mansion takes place in a large mansion, just outside of a creepy forest. The game opens with <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> exiting said forest to arrive at the mansion. Upon heading inside, Luigi encounters a bunch of ghosts and a mysterious scientist who attempts to save him with a mysterious device. Upon fleeing from the mansion, the scientist is found to be Professor E. Gadd, who lives near the mansion because he has been studying it. Explaining how he won the mansion in a contest he didn't enter, Luigi finds that his brother, <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>, went into the mansion and hasn't come out. E. Gadd equips him with a special ghost-hunting vacuum, called the \" <a href=\"/poltergust-3000/3055-599/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-599\">Poltergust 3000</a>\", and sends him to clear the mansion of ghosts, and to rescue Mario.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Luigi's Mansion has Luigi hunting through a large mansion to save his brother, armed with a vacuum and a special Game Boy. To capture ghosts, Luigi must first make the ghost show their heart. This is accomplished by shining Luigi's flashlight on the ghost, appropriately stunning the ghost, and allowing Luigi to suck them in with the Poltergust, his vacuum.</p><h3>The Poltergust 3000</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338639\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81923076923077\" data-width=\"260\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 260px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338639\"><img alt=\"Luigi Fighting a Ghost\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3067/338639-a_med_03b.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\"></a><figcaption>Luigi Fighting a Ghost</figcaption></figure><p>The process of sucking them doesn't happen in an instant, and the ghost can fight back; Luigi has to keep pulling them in until their health hits zero, then they'll be sucked into the vacuum for all time. The ghosts can remain in the vacuum, but the 'boss ghosts' are put into portraits that go up in E. Gadd's gallery. Boss ghosts are extracted from the vacuum at the end of every area Luigi completes. The Poltergust can also be upgraded with medallions as the game goes on, allowing Luigi to shoot fire, ice, and water instead of just blowing air. This is used to complete puzzles, and can also be used as a weapon.</p><h3>The Game Boy Horror</h3><p>The special Game Boy is known as the Game Boy Horror. Luigi can use it to research items in the mansion, contact E. Gadd, navigate using its map, look at items, and even check if a Boo is in a room. The Game Boy Horror will also tell Luigi what room he has the door-key to on the map, making it easier to navigate. Additionally, if Luigi uses the Game Boy Horror to scan any of the mirrors in the mansion they will warp him back to the foyer, providing a convenient short cut when needing to save game progress with Toad.</p><h3>The Mansion</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844499\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844499\"><img alt=\"Luigi creeps up to the mansion.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Luigi creeps up to the mansion.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844499-mansion.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Luigi creeps up to the mansion.</figcaption></figure><p>The mansion itself is full of many surprises. It stays in the dark most of the time, unless Luigi clears a room of ghosts. Many rooms when completely cleared will also have treasure chests or keys, allowing Luigi to continue his search of the mansion. The mansion is five floors in all, including a basement and the roof, with the player starting in the foyer. Each floor has a boss to defeat, and certain objectives must be completed to reach the next floor.</p><p>Once the player has beaten the game, Luigi will use the money he's earned over the course of the game to build a new mansion in place of the old one. The size and grade of the mansion depends on how much money Luigi made over the course of the game.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Money</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rank A</td><td>100,000,000G +</td></tr><tr><td>Rank B</td><td>70,000,001G - 99,999,999G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank C</td><td>60,000,001G - 70,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank D</td><td>50,000,001G - 60,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank E</td><td>40,000,001G - 50,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank F</td><td>20,000,001G - 40,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank G</td><td>5,000,001G - 20,000,000G</td></tr><tr><td>Rank H</td><td>5,000G - 5,000,000G</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Ghost Gallery</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2301755\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2301755\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12337/2301755-Vincent_Van_Gore.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Professor E.Gadd has a gallery of ghost portraits in his workshop, unfortunately they all escaped when King Boo let them free. As Luigi catches the portrait ghosts they will be turned back into portraits using E.Gadd's Ghost Portrificationizer. Depending on how well Luigi captures the ghosts, the portraits will have either a bronze, silver or gold frame.</p><p>The frame is based on how much HP Luigi takes of a ghost in one go:</p><p><b>Bronze:</b> If Luigi only manages to suck up less than 50HP.</p><p><b>Silver:</b> If Luigi sucks up more than 50HP in one go.</p><p><b>Gold:</b> If Luigi can suck up 90HP or more in one go.</p><p>To determine the frame of one of the 4 boss ghosts, it is based on how much HP Luigi had left after the fight:</p><p><b>Bronze:</b> If Luigi fails to keep his health over 50HP.</p><p><b>Silver:</b> If Luigi manages to keep his health over 50HP.</p><p><b>Gold:</b> Luigi must enter the battle with 100HP and keep it over 90HP to get the gold frame.</p><h3>The Hidden Mansion</h3><p>Once the final boss is defeated, Luigi is given a rating based on how much treasure he gathered throughout the game. This only effects a small portion of the ending sequence. Also, the Hidden Mansion is unlocked. What the Hidden Mansion is depends on the player's version of the game. Bosses may be switched, the entire Mansion may have been mirrored, there may be more ghosts, or maybe even faster Boos; but, it all depends on the player's version of the game.</p>",

Metroid Prime combines multiple gameplay elements, such as platforming, <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles</a>, <a href=\"/exploration/3015-767/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-767\">exploration</a> and shooting, while presenting a large, <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-ended world</a>.</p><p>Metroid Prime revolves around <a href=\"/phazon/3015-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-49\">Phazon</a>, a highly radioactive substance with mutagenic properties. The game takes place on <a href=\"/tallon-iv/3035-168/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\">Tallon IV</a>, which has been corrupted by this substance. Throughout her journey, <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus</a> learns more about the nature of Phazon, as well as how her enemies, the <a href=\"/space-pirate/3015-1137/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1137\">Space Pirates</a>, intend to use it. She also learns of the <a href=\"/chozo/3015-605/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-605\">Chozo</a>'s struggles, an ancient race that lived on Tallon IV when the infection first arrived.</p><p>As well as maintaining most of the traditional Metroid gameplay features, Metroid Prime introduces a number of innovations to the series. The first person perspective led to the introduction of <a href=\"/auto-aim/3015-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-145\">lock-on targeting</a>, which allowed for a more intuitive combat system, as well as the ability to strafe around enemies. A <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">heads-up display</a> was introduced, which showed Samus' health bar and ammunition, among other details. A multiple visor system was incorporated, which allowed for different kinds of displays. The most intriguing display was the scan visor, which allowed a multitude of objects and creatures to be surveyed in great detail, as well as activating lifts and revealing <a href=\"/weak-spot/3015-296/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-296\">weak points</a>. A hint system was built into the game to aid players.</p><p>Metroid Prime saw great success worldwide, particularly in America. This commercial success led to the development of a Metroid Prime trilogy, as well as other Metroid Prime spinoffs.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>When Metroid Prime was revealed, the most controversial aspect of the game was its first-person perspective. With the game's release, however, reception eventually turned positive, with many generally accepting that the gameplay did not suffer at all from the new perspective.</p><p>Metroid Prime, like its predecessors, places a large emphasis on exploration. <a href=\"/tallon-iv/3035-168/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\">Tallon IV</a> is an open world, ready for Samus to discover all its secrets, fitting with Metroid tradition. There are only a few instances in the game where the player is given a linear direction, albeit through subtle hints.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492600\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492600\"><img alt=\"The Parasite Queen blasts Samus with a beam of energy.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Parasite Queen blasts Samus with a beam of energy.</figcaption></figure><p>The player controls Samus using the analog control stick. Unlike other first-person games of the era, Metroid Prime is controlled primarily with a single analog stick, rather then the dual stick format. In order to look around, players must use the R button. The R button allows the players to use the analog stick to look around and observe the environment, as well as aim at opponents. Samus also has the ability to jump using the B button. Platforming is an important element of Metroid Prime, as in previous entries in the series. Metroid Prime has been praised for its excellence in platforming, something few thought executed well in the first-person perspective.</p><p>Combat in Metroid Prime is similar to that of most other first-person shooter games, utilizing a variety of weapons. Samus fires using the A button, and when in the <a href=\"/morph-ball/3055-1049/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">morph ball</a>, Samus uses the A button to drop bombs. To lock on to enemies, Samus uses the L button. By lightly pressing the L button while locked on, Samus can swap out targets. If the player does not wish to lock on, they can look freely using the R button, and aim at opponents through that method. While locked on, the player can press the B button to dash from side to side. Samus must use all of her beam weapons, as well as her missiles, activated with the Y button.</p><p>The C-stick is used to select the weapon which Samus will use. Samus's basic weapon is the power beam, which she begins with. Throughout the course of the game, Samus can obtain the <a href=\"/plasma-beam/3055-1024/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1024\">plasma beam</a>, the <a href=\"/wave-beam/3055-1023/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1023\">wave beam</a>, and the <a href=\"/ice-beam/3055-906/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-906\">ice beam</a>. The plasma beam shoots short tang molten energy and can potentially ignite enemies, as well as melt ice. The wave beam fires three oscillating waves of electric energy, and has a limited homing effect. The ice beam is a cold blast of frozen water, and has a slow rate of fire. It can also potentially freeze an enemy in their tracks for a brief amount of time. Each weapon is strong against particular enemies, and all can be combo fires with Samus' missiles for greater effect. Once Samus obtains the charge beam, all weapons can be charged up as well, providing greater firepower.</p><p>In order to access many areas, Samus must use her weapons to destroy obstacles. Many doors are blocked by shields which require certain weapons to activate, and others have blast shields that must be destroyed with the missiles.</p><p>Samus has a variety of <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">visors</a> which will come in handy throughout the game, as well. The standard visor is the combat visor, which is used through regular gameplay. One of the most important visors, which Samus has at the beginning of the game, is the <a href=\"/scan-visor/3055-1040/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1040\">scan visor</a>. The scan visor is used to scan nearly everything in the environment. Scanning proves useful for gathering details about enemies, and discovering the most efficient way of taking them out. Scanning is also one of the main ways that Metroid Prime implements world-building, providing information on the lifeforms in proximity to Samus, as well as translating diary entries and other logs. Another useful visor is the <a href=\"/thermal-visor/3055-1042/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1042\">thermal visor</a>, which helps Samus track objects in the environment based on their heat signature. This visor is quite helpful in dark areas, enabling samus to see lifeforms clearly. Finally, the <a href=\"/x-ray-visor/3055-1041/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1041\">X-ray</a> vison allows Samus to look through walls to find secret passages, and track enemies who use <a href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">optical camouflage</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492601\"><img alt=\"A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.</figcaption></figure><p>Like all previous Metroid games, Samus can transform into the morph ball. The morph ball is activated using the X button. Combat is limited, however, in morph ball mode, and Samus can only use the bombs, dropped using the A or Y buttons. The bombs prove most useful for morph ball jumping. A morph ball jump is performed by laying a bomb, then lingering over the bomb, which will shoot Samus into the air. Multiple bombs can be laid to reach higher areas.</p><p>One of the most useful tools in the game is the map. The <a href=\"/world-map/3015-611/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">map</a> is accessed using the Z button, and is a detailed three dimensional depiction of Tallon IV. As exploration is so important in Metroid Prime, consulting the map becomes regular throughout the course of the game.</p><p>As in all Metroid games, items are scattered across the planet. Samus begins with a number of suit upgrades. After an accident on the Frigate, however, Samus begins on Tallon IV with merely her power beam and power suit. As she explores more and more, she can regain her arsenal. Most weapons and visors are hidden throughout the game, and in order to obtain them and move further on in the game, Samus must find out how to reach them. Not all items are essential to the player's progress; however, some will prove very useful. Energy tanks and missile tanks are not required, but are still of great assistance. Some of the more notable items Samus can find are the <a href=\"/varia-suit/3055-1032/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1032\">Varia Suit</a> and <a href=\"/gravity-suit/3055-1033/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1033\">Gravity Suit</a>, as well as the <a href=\"/hi-jump-boots/3055-1448/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1448\">space jump boots</a>, which allow Samus to <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double jump</a>. Metroid Prime also marked the return of the <a href=\"/grapple-beam/3055-1053/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1053\">Grapple Beam</a> from <a href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid</a>, which allowed Samus to grapple onto specific points and swing over great distances.</p><h3>Wii Release</h3><p>On October 2, 2008, Nintendo revealed plans to bring various Gamecube games over to the Wii with new controls, including Metroid Prime. The official name of the Wii release is called \"<a href=\"/new-play-control/3025-1197/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1197\">New Play Control</a>! Metroid Prime\". In this rerelease, players control Samus with the Wiimote and Nunchuck, matching the controls of <a href=\"/metroid-prime-3-corruption/3030-4725/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4725\">Metroid Prime 3</a>. Movement is controlled by the analog stick on the Nunchuck. The biggest change to the controls is the aiming, which is now controlled by the Wii's IR pointer. Lock-on is still available and is done via the Z button. Shooting is mapped to the A button (missiles and other weapons on the directional pad) while jumping is controlled by the B button. As in Metroid Prime 3, changing visors is done by pressing the minus button and choosing the visor wanted by pointing on screen. Despite these changes, the Wii rerelease is the same Metroid Prime that was played on the GameCube. The Wii release also has 16:9 Widescreen and 480p support.</p><h2>Regions</h2><h3>Frigate Orpheon</h3><p>A Space Pirate frigate, this vessel was used by the Space Pirate Science Team for <a href=\"/experiments-gone-awry/3015-2046/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2046\">experiments</a>, some more bizarre than others. This is where the <a href=\"/parasite-queen/3005-4286/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4286\">Parasite Queen</a> resides, as well as the place that gave birth to a reborn <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a>. In the beginning of the game, it is still partly functional. Samus eventually returns to the ruins of the Frigate.</p><h3>Tallon Overworld</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208454\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208454\"><img alt=\"A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.</figcaption></figure><p>The place where Samus first lands, the Overworld is a green place, always raining.

Quite useful in confusing situations with an overwhelming number of enemies. The Spreader uses ten missiles.</p><h3>Plasma Beam</h3><p>The Plasma Beam, while fast, has a short range. It can set some enemies on fire due to the extreme heat. The charged version of this beam can melt thick ice with cracks.</p><h4>Flamethrower</h4><p>The flamethrower is a short range weapon that leaves behind fire on whatever it makes contact with, damaging things that touch it. It uses up ten Missiles over two seconds.</p><h2>Suit and Ability Upgrades</h2><p>Samus obtains various upgrades throughout the course of her adventure. These take many forms, and harken back to the original Metroid games.</p><h3>Varia Suit</h3><p>The Varia Suit is the first suit upgrade Samus receives, and the one she is most often associated with.

It also recolours her suit with an indigo accent in place of the orange palette most associated with her. It is acquired in the Gravity Chamber in Phendrana Drifts.</p><h3>Phazon Suit</h3><p>The result of an overload of pure Phazon, the Phazon Suit is shades of black, silver, and crimson. It protects Samus from the effects of blue phazon (though not orange phazon), and provides the most damage reduction of any suit. It also allows her to use the powerful Phazon beam, only available during her final battle. This upgrade is obtained after the battle with the Omega Pirate, in the Phazon Mines.</p><h3>Visors</h3><p>Samus' visor has many different capabilities.

At first, only five missiles are available to be stored onhand, but this is upgradeable by finding one of many missile expansions throughout the world. They are more powerful than a standard beam shot, and can hone in on targets, as well as opening doors and destroying certain materials.</p><h3>Morph Ball</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-273893\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-273893\"><img alt=\"The Spider Ball in use.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Spider Ball in use.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Spider Ball in use.</figcaption></figure><p>In morph ball mode, Samus becomes a ball of pure energy, encased in her power suit, and can roll around, allowing access to areas previously out of reach. It is gotten once the Plated Beetle in the Chozo Ruins has been defeated. It has various upgrades:</p><p><b>Bombs</b> - Getting this upgrade allows Samus to drop small bombs while in Morph Ball form. These can destroy certain materials, are effective against many enemies, and can even serve a purpose in some boss fights. They can also be dropped into bomb slots to activate certain things. It is gotten once the Incinerator Drone in the Chozo Ruins has been beaten.</p><p><b>Power Bombs</b> - Able to destroy Bendezium objects and stronger enemies, the Power Bomb is one of Samus' strongest weapons. The number available can be expanded. This upgrade is obtained by defeating the Beta Drone and passing through the maze in the Phazon Mines.</p><p><b>Boost Bal</b>l - This upgrade affords Samus a short burst of speed while in Morph Ball mode. Useful for traversing half-pipes and defeating smaller enemies. Acquired in Phendrana Canyon in Phendrana Drifts.</p><p><b>Spider Ball</b> - This upgrade allows Samus to stick to and roll along the magnetic tracks that wind around Tallon IV. Bombs provide a small jump off the track. This is gotten by defeating Thardus in Phendrana Drifts.</p><h3>Space Jump Boots</h3><p>These boots give Samus the ability to double jump.

This led Nintendo to clarify that the game is a \"First Person Adventure\" and not a first-person shooter. Once the game was released, however, many critics and former detractors praised the game's level design and incredible graphics. It was stated as being a great reinvention of the Metroid franchise into 3D. Many stated that the gameplay was well done and that the lock-on feature was a welcome addition as it allowed easy strafing. Still, some stated that the controls were difficult and that a traditional first-person control scheme, where the left analog stick controls movement and the right controls direction, should have been included. </p>",

Alucard, the main character, will navigate the many sectors of Dracula's castle with flexibility in his progression. The castle is maze like, with many hidden passages, deadly obstacles, and increasingly difficult enemies. The game incorporates the classic Castlevania platform gameplay, and mixes it with the exploration of titles like Super Metroid and Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. To progress, Alucard must gather powers, defeat bosses, and discover the secrets of Dracula's domain.</p><p>Symphony of the Night is the first Castlevania title to allow players to use other primary weapons besides whips, which was traditional in the series prior to this game. Alucard's repertoire, however, is mostly based on edged weapons, such as axes and swords. Other weapons, such as fist weapons and single use, expendable weapons, are available though much less common. Symphony of the Night's alternate characters, Richter and Maria, have unique weapons. Richter plays like characters in the previous titles, wielding the legendary Vampire Killer and utilizing classic sub-weapons. Maria uses energy-based projectiles and kicks to do battle. Armor and accessories could also be equipped, granting the player bonuses to all of their characters stats. The Sega Saturn version expands on the items in the game, and has many bonus weapons and armor sets.</p><p>Players could also pick up other items, such as food, to help replenish health and hearts. Items such as the classic Castlevania haunch of meat will replenish health, while sweet treats like ice cream generally refill Alucard's hearts. Players must be wary, however, as not everything is good for the character's stomach. Poison mushrooms, rotten meat, and other unsavory goods will cause status effects, among other harmful effects. These items do not have effect upon contact, as in past Castlevania titles. Rather, they will be placed in the inventory, and must be equipped to one of Alucard's arms. Once equipped, pressing the button the food is assigned to will throw them out, and Alucard can use them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/285272-symphony_of_the_night_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-285272\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81428571428571\" data-width=\"280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/285272-symphony_of_the_night_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-285272\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/285272-symphony_of_the_night_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/285272-symphony_of_the_night_02.jpg 280w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/285272-symphony_of_the_night_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/285272-symphony_of_the_night_02.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-width=\"280\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Sub-weapons also make a return in Symphony of the Night, including old favorites like Holy Water and the Throwing axe. These sub-weapons consume hearts, which can be regenerated by picking up additional hearts, dropped by enemies, as well as lights sources once Alucard obtains the Cube of Zoe. Item crashes return from the previous game, which are special powered up versions of the equipped sub-weapon. Only Maria and Richter can perform item crashes. Each weapon has different effects depending on what character uses them. Along with sub-weapons, special creatures could be equipped as aids in combat. These creatures, called familiars, include fairies and demons. Familiars have a variety of different effects in combat, including healing, fighting, and defense. These familiars level up along with Alucard, becoming stronger with each level.</p><p>Symphony of the Night also introduces a magic system to the series. Players can perform various spells for attacking and healing by pressing secret button combinations. There are a number of attack spells, such as Hellfire, and others that heal, such as Dark Metamorphosis, which heals Alucard any time he spills blood from an enemy. The player can buy Incantation Scrolls in the Library, but they are not needed to unlock the ability to perform the spells.</p><p>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is vastly different from previous entries in the series. There are still candles that contain hearts and sub-weapons, but they are functionally different. The game also deviates from the traditional linear level format, much like <a href=\"/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\">Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a>. While progress is still limited by items and abilities granted by defeating bosses and exploring the map, the player can choose where to go (A number of tricks and glitches also allows them, with enough know how, to get into places they shouldn't be). In another break from tradition, Symphony of the Night introduces an entire armory allowing Alucard to wield anything from a standard sword to brass knuckles to sticks of dynamite. Previous Castlevania titles only allowed for the whip and two upgrades for it, never allowing alternate equips. Upon finding certain relics, the player can choose to have a familiar follow them. The Fairy provides healing when damaged and antidotes when poisoned. The Bat, Sword, Ghost, and Demon are all combat-oriented. Some of them are necessary to access hidden areas. The active familiar will gain experience with every monster you kill, increasing that familiar's skill in battle or in support.</p><p>Relics are hidden throughout the castle which provide or upgrade Alucard's abilities . Relics will allow him to jump higher, collect hearts and items from light sources, equip familiars, and open sealed doors, among other things. These can be turned on and off in the menu screen. Some relics will allow Alucard to transform into beasts or mist. The first transformation is the wolf, who can run faster, and make long, running jumps. The wolf attacks with a short ranged bite. The second transformation is the bat, similar to Alucard's power in <a href=\"/castlevania-iii-draculas-curse/3030-19328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19328\">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a>, which can fly freely around the stages. Finally, the mist power will allow Alucard to float around, through grates and other obstacles impassable by other states of matter. The mist can also be upgraded to a poison mist, which damages enemies. When in these forms, Alucard's MP will slowly be drained. Each for becomes necessary to advance in the game, and obtain many hidden secrets.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276476-33.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-276476\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276476-33.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-276476\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276476-33.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276476-33.png 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8480/276476-33.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276476-33.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276476-33.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276476-33.png 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8480/276476-33.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276476-33.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Symphony of the Night was the second Castlevania game to feature RPG elements, after Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. Enemies give experience points when killed, and Alucard will level up after gaining the required experience. Alucard can also gather Life Max and Heart Max upgrades. These RPG elements have become a mainstay mechanic in the series since, as have many other elements of Symphony of the Night.</p><h3>Richter Belmont Gameplay</h3><p>In most versions of the game, it is possible for the player to take control of Richter Belmont, the vampire hunter. After satisfying certain conditions, the player can enter their name as \"RICHTER\" and they will be put in his shoes to explore Castlevania. Richter does not collect items, cannot equip anything, does not find relics, cannot use familiars, and does not level up. Playing as Richter is very much like previous games, with more limited character mobility. He does not have any MP, and his heart maximum capacity is 99. Heart Max items only replenish hearts. He can, however, increase his life maximum when he collects life max up items. His only primary weapon is the <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3055-284/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-284\">vampire killer</a>, which cannot be powered up (save his whip item crash and increased power in the inverted castle). Richter wields the same sub-weapons as Alucard, but has the ability to perform and item crash that eats up a large number of hearts, and performs a strong attack.</p><h3>Sub-Weapons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-276474\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.63541666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-276474\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8480/276474-2d_ss1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><b>Dagger</b>: The weakest of all sub-weapons, yet very fast, and costs a single heart.</li><li><b>Axe</b>: Alucard tosses a round axe into the air.

Since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was designed to accommodate PlayStation's virtually non-existent 2D capabilities (most graphical elements that appear to be 2D are actually textures that were applied to front-facing 3D polygons), the Sega Saturn port resulted in some trade-offs, mainly slowdown instances, longer loading times, and modified graphical effects.</p><p>The port, however, includes more content than the original version. In addition to two exclusive areas (the Cursed Prison and the Underground Garden, each with their own inverted version) and various exclusive enemies and items, the version also includes a new playable character, Maria Renard, and a character select screen that allows you to play as Alucard, Richter, or Maria without any need for cheat codes.</p><h3>Xbox Live Arcade</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242639\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56129032258065\" data-width=\"465\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 465px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242639\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg 465w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg 465w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242639-castlevania_symphony_of_the_night_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was ported to the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> via <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live Arcade</a> by <a href=\"/backbone-entertainment/3010-985/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-985\">Backbone Entertainment</a> and was released for 800 msp ($10) on March 21, 2007 in North America and July 25, 2007 in Japan. The game features achievements, leaderboards, background wallpapers for widescreen televisions, and a graphical filter that blurs the visuals for a finer image. It was the first XBLA game to exceed the original size restriction (50 megabytes) placed upon XBLA games.

She uses owls as her primary means of attack, with four animal friends as sub-weapons. The English versions of the game feature new voice acting and a re-translated script.

The game was developed by <a href=\"/clover-studio/3010-3345/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3345\">Clover Studio</a>, and the port for the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> was developed by <a href=\"/ready-at-dawn-studios-llc/3010-5291/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5291\">Ready at Dawn Studios</a> which was released in North America on April 15, 2008, and released in Europe on June 13, 2008, respectively. A high definition remaster, developed by <a href=\"/hexa-drive/3010-6576/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6576\">Hexa Drive</a>, was released through the <a href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PlayStation Network</a> on <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> on October 30, 2012, and features <a href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\">PlayStation Move support</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In Ōkami, the player controls the sun goddess Amaterasu, who takes the form of a wolf. Ōkami is somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">The</a> <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda</a> games; Ōkami director <a href=\"/hideki-kamiya/3040-60123/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-60123\">Hideki Kamiya</a> has stated that <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Zelda</a> had a huge influence on himself and the game.</p><p>The player starts the game in the northern parts of Hokkaido, <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>, and travels through the game world in linear fashion, saving each area from evil by rejuvenating Guardian Saplings. Ammy (the nickname given to Amaterasu by <a href=\"/issun/3005-1295/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1295\">Issun</a>) does this primarily with the Celestial Brush, a paintbrush with powers awarded by the 13 brush gods that she meets over the course of the game.</p><p>The battle system is rather unique, in that it combines elements of role-playing and action-adventure games. Groups of enemies in the overworld are depicted as scrolls surrounded by plumes of colored fire. When Amaterasu comes in contact with one, a barrier entraps her in a sort of arena. In this arena, the player must fight foes using one of three weapon types: glaives (sword-like, attacks offensively), reflectors (shield-like, acts defensively as a sub-weapon), and rosaries (bead-like weapons for ranged combat). Each can be equipped either as a primary or secondary weapon, allowing one to find a personal combat style. Players receive yen and, on rare occasions, demon fangs, for successfully defeating a group of enemies. Both can be used to buy various consumables, buffs, and upgrades for Amaterasu.</p><h3>The Celestial Brush</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13353/457269-81867_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457269\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.752\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13353/457269-81867_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457269\"><img alt=\"The Celestial Brush in action.

Here, it's calling up a gust of wind.</figcaption></figure><p>The brush mechanic in Ōkami is one of the game's most unique aspects. By pressing and holding down R1 (on the PS2 version) or B (on the Wii version), time freezes and the screen seemingly turns into a canvas, although players can still move the camera freely. Using Ammy's tail like a paintbrush, players can paint various symbols over the screen -- which, once the button is released, result in different effects.</p><p>Over the course of the game, players collect 16 brush techniques, granted to them by Ammy's peers and fellow gods. Most serve multiple functions, as not only do they help Ammy explore the world and get past obstacles, but they can also be used in battle:</p><ul><li><b>Sunrise:</b> Amaterasu's innate ability, this technique allows her to summon the sun, turning night back to day. Triggered by painting a circle in the sky.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Rejuvenation:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/yomigami/3005-9610/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9610\">Yomigami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to restore broken objects to their original form, such as repairing broken bridges. Triggered by completely painting over the broken area.</li><li><b>Power Slash:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/tachigami/3005-9611/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9611\">Tachigami</a>, this technique lets Ammy slash through objects and enemies alike. Triggered by painting a straight, horizontal line over the desired target.</li><li><b>Cherry Bomb:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/bakugami/3005-9612/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9612\">Bakugami</a>, this technique lets Ammy create a bomb that can be used to open new passages and damage enemies in battle. Triggered by drawing a circle with a line going through one of the edges.</li><li><b>Greensprout: Bloom:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/sakigami/3005-9609/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9609\">Sakigami</a> -- one of the triumvirate Hanagami flora gods -- this technique causes flowers to bloom and rejuvenates withered trees. Triggered by painting a circle over the flower or tree.</li><li><b>Greensprout: Water Lily:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/hasugami/3005-9614/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9614\">Hasugami</a> -- another one of the Hanagami flora gods -- this technique allows Ammy to create a path of lily pads on water so that she can cross large bodies of water. Triggered by painting a circle on the water.</li><li><b>Greensprout: Vine:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/tsutagami/3005-9615/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9615\">Tsutagami</a> -- the last of the Hanagami flora gods -- this technique allows Ammy create a vine that spawns out of Konohana blossom and can be attached to certain objects, or Ammy to reach otherwise inaccessible places. Triggered by painting a line from a Konohana blossom to Amaterasu.</li><li><b>Watersprout:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/nuregami/3005-9616/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9616\">Nuregami</a>, this technique can be used to move water to different places, and activate Power Springs that can be used to ascend to higher ground. Triggered by either drawing a line from the water to a desired target, or drawing a line straight up from a power spring.</li><li><b>Crescent:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/yumigami/3005-9617/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9617\">Yumigami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to turn day to night by bringing out the moon. Triggered by drawing a crescent shape in the sky, with the edges pointing left.</li><li><b>Galestorm:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/kazegami/3005-9618/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9618\">Kazegami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to create gusts of wind. Triggered by drawing a line with a loop in the middle in whichever direction the player want the wind to travel, or a spiral shape to make it go forward.</li><li><b>Inferno:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/moegami/3005-9619/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9619\">Moegami</a>, this technique lets Ammy move fire to different places, which can be used to melt ice or damage enemies. Triggered by drawing a line from the source of fire to the desired target.</li><li><b>Veil of Mist:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/kasugami/3005-9620/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9620\">Kasugami</a>, this technique allows Ammy to temporarily slow down time. Triggered by drawing two horizontal lines parallel to each other.</li><li><b>Catwalk:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/kabegami/3005-9621/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9621\">Kabegami</a>, this technique lets Ammy stick to walls that have cat prints on them. Triggered by drawing a line straight up from a cat statue.</li><li><b>Thunderstorm:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/gekigami/3005-9622/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9622\">Gekigami</a>, this technique lets Ammy shock enemies or objects with bolts of lightning. Triggered by drawing a line from the source of lightning to the desired target.</li><li><b>Blizzard:</b> Granted by <a href=\"/itegami/3005-9623/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9623\">Itegami</a>, this technique lets Ammy freeze things or create bridges of ice. Triggered by drawing a line connecting the source of ice to the desired target.</li></ul><p>There are also extra techniques and upgraded versions of existing strokes that can be found by completing side quests and exploring the world. These are:</p><ul><li><b>Fireburst:</b> An upgraded version of Inferno, Fireburst allows Ammy to call upon the power of Fire whenever she wants by drawing an infinity symbol (a horizontal 8), and roasts all enemies on screen to a crisp when used in battle.</li><li><b>Whirlwind:</b> An upgraded version of Galestorm, Whirlwind, when activated, calls upon a tornado that continuously damages for the duration it is active. It is activated by drawing three horizontal lines parallel to each other.</li><li><b>Mist Warp:</b> This ability grants Amaterasu the ability to teleport across Nippon via objects known as \"Ultimate Origin Mirrors\" (otherwise known as save points), by drawing an X upon the mirror's surface.</li><li><b>Fountain:</b> Fountain is similar to Mist Warp in that it allows Amaterasu to quickly teleport across Nippon, but instead of using mirrors to do so, Fountain utilizes Mermaid Springs -- small, glowing sections of water spread throughout Nippon.

The game uses <a href=\"/cel-shading/3015-173/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-173\">cel-shaded</a> graphics to emulate the look of traditional Japanese sumi-e brush art. (Sumi-e involves painting with brushes on traditional washi-paper, which is commonly used for calligraphy and making Japanese paper cranes.)</p><p>Clover Studio initially intended to employ a more realistic aesthetic in Ōkami, but the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2</a> was deemed too weak to render their original vision. The <a href=\"/celestial-brush/3055-355/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-355\">Celestial Brush</a> mechanic used to draw in the game also influenced the decision to use cel-shading.</p><h2>Wii Port</h2><p>In the Wii release, the staff credits were removed from the game. The director of Ōkami, <a href=\"/hideki-kamiya/3040-60123/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-60123\">Hideki Kamiya</a>, stated his thoughts about their removal on a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=16464768311%26amp%3Bref=mf\" rel=\"nofollow\">officially translated blog entry,</a> stating, \"It was a special staff roll for a special moment. And now it is gone. All of it. ...It’s incredibly disappointing and sad.\"</p><p><a href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a> U.S. had this to say in response: \"The credits were removed because they were a pre-rendered movie that contained the Clover logo. We have no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly. We also didn't have the source to the credit movie itself, so we couldn't just use it and remove the Clover logo.\" The credits were added for the Japanese release of the game, however, which was more than a year after the game's release in English speaking territories.</p><p>The Wii version is infamous for having a not-so-subtly hidden <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IGN</a> watermark on its cover that caused Capcom to offer some new cover art for a short while after the discovery was made.</p><h3>Wii port differences</h3><ul><li>Motion controls added for celestial brush and combat</li><li>Paper filter effect removed from the screen</li></ul><h2>Ōkami HD</h2><p>An HD port of Ōkami, developed by <a href=\"/hexa-drive/3010-6576/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6576\">Hexa Drive</a>, was released on the <a href=\"/playstation-network/3015-2623/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2623\">PlayStation Network</a> on October 30th, 2012 for $20. It features a 1080p HD native resolution, <a href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\">PlayStation Move support</a>, and <a href=\"/playstation-trophies/3015-198/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-198\">trophies</a>. Just like the Wii version, it does not have the rice paper filter found in the original PS2 release. Though there is an option to increase the filter to make it look like the original PS2 release. This means the HD version is most likely an up-res of the Wii version with the <a href=\"/wii-remote/3055-1304/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1304\">Wii remote</a> controls being mimicked with the PlayStation Move. The developer has even stated that they used <a href=\"/ready-at-dawn-studios-llc/3010-5291/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5291\">Ready At Dawn</a>'s work on the widescreen-adjustment of the Wii port to keep the game in 16:9. They have also stated that many effects and graphical blemishes have been removed or outright changed to help with the HD look and strongly imply that it is not just a simple port/up-resing.</p><p>There are 51 trophies: 42 bronze, 5 silver, 3 gold, and 1 platinum.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ol><li>According to <em>Guinness Book of World Records 2010: Gamers Edition,</em> Ōkami is the least commercially successful Game of the Year winner, selling under 600,000 copies by March 2009.</li><li><em>Amaterasu</em> is the name of a Japanese Goddess.</li><li>Ōkami means both \"<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/wolf/3015-2265/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2265\">wolf</a>\" and \"great <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/gods/3015-1047/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1047\">god</a>\" in Japanese, making the title a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/double-entendre-in-game-names/3015-1123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1123\">double entendre</a>.</li></ol>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>MDK (which may stand for \"Murder, Death, Kill\", but is jokingly given the name \"Mission: Deliver Kindness\" in-game) is a third-person shooter from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-736\" href=\"/shiny-entertainment-inc/3010-736/\" slug=\"shiny-entertainment-inc\">Shiny Entertainment</a>. In it, the player takes control of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5643\" href=\"/kurt-hectic/3005-5643/\" slug=\"kurt-hectic\">Kurt Hectic</a>, a janitor of the eccentric <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13193\" href=\"/dr-fluke-hawkins/3005-13193/\" slug=\"dr-fluke-hawkins\">Dr. Fluke Hawkins</a>.

However, the good doctor has foreseen this threat and plans a counter attack. He entrusts his latest inventions, including the \"amazing\" Coil Suit, and the \"extraordinary\" chain-gun, to our hero Kurt. With the occasional help of his six-legged canine companion Bones (AKA, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13215\" href=\"/max/3005-13215/\" slug=\"max\">Max</a>), Kurt takes the fight into the heart of the enemy stronghold.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490868-mdk31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490868\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490868-mdk31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490868\"><img alt=\"Kurt\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490868-mdk31.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490868-mdk31.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1070/490868-mdk31.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490868-mdk31.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Kurt</figcaption></figure><p>Battles take place in large arenas linked by <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2227\" href=\"/tunnel/3035-2227/\" slug=\"tunnel\">tunnels</a> (which are actually just cleverly disguised <a data-ref-id=\"3015-106\" href=\"/loading-screens/3015-106/\" slug=\"loading-screens\">loading screens</a>). After dispatching various waves of enemies, Kurt moves on to the next arena. The variety of the arenas is a highlight, from typical war zones to prisons to childish painted walls that add to the game's bizarre sense of humor. How many other games feature \" <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2026\" href=\"/bizzare-weapons/3015-2026/\" slug=\"bizzare-weapons\">the world's smallest nuclear bomb</a>\"? As a treat for fans of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-171\" href=\"/earthworm-jim/3025-171/\" slug=\"earthworm-jim\">Earthworm Jim</a> (Shiny's key franchise), some levels included <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3108\" href=\"/cow/3015-3108/\" slug=\"cow\">cows</a> falling from the sky onto enemies if the right power-up was found.</p><p>MDK's developers capitalized on ground breaking Motion Capture technology. This led to some of the best animation and graphics of its day. It also provided spectacular environments and some of the most original concepts seen in gaming. From the bizarre head gear Kurt is forced to wear, which doubles as a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a> and chain gun, to the \"incredible\" ribbon chute, MDK's character design makes it one of the more original PC shooters. It found itself on consoles soon after.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>MDK's story is set in the form of a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2022\" href=\"/diary/3055-2022/\" slug=\"diary\">diary</a> of an eccentric inventor, named Dr. Fluke Hawkins. Dr. Hawkins discovers something that he humorously calls \"Flange Orbits,\" but when he relates this to the scientific community, he is shunned and ridiculed.</p><p>Dr. Fluke Hawkins then goes out to build a <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1695\" href=\"/space-station/3035-1695/\" slug=\"space-station\">space station</a>, which he names 'The Jim Dandy.' He then bribes his laboratory janitor (Kurt Hectic) to join him by giving him some Hungarian goulash, and blasts himself into a self-imposed exile in outer space, swearing never to return until he \"comes up with some really good stuff.\" Upon entering orbit, he realizes that the \"Flange Orbits\" he theorized about didn't actually exist. Rather than go back to Earth humiliated, he begins to work on a robotic dog that Dr. Hawkins calls \"Bones\" (the dog prefers \" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13215\" href=\"/max/3005-13215/\" slug=\"max\">Max</a>\").</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490774-mdk68.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490774\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490774-mdk68.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490774\"><img alt=\"Inside a Minecrawler\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490774-mdk68.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490774-mdk68.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1070/490774-mdk68.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490774-mdk68.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Inside a Minecrawler</figcaption></figure><p>Dr. Hawkins continues work in harmony until he one day notices a strange phenomenon: long streams of some sort of energy are heading straight for the Earth. The Doctor sent down a warning (along with a basket of Max's delicious oranges) but was promptly ignored. The streams proceeded to create massive hordes of enemies in \"Minecrawlers,\" giant fortress-cities designed to strip the mineral wealth (and potato crop, according to Dr. Hawkins) from the planet. The military forces of Earth were swiftly crushed by the alien invasion.</p><p>Dr. Hawkins decides to take immediate action. Pairing his new \"Coil Suit\", a revolutionary, futuristic armor suit capable of repelling \"bullets, bees, and small but very hard sticks\" that holds a retractable/re-usable \"ribbon chute\" for <a data-ref-id=\"3055-504\" href=\"/parachute/3055-504/\" slug=\"parachute\">parachuting</a> and/or gliding. The suit also contains an arm-mounted chaingun that also serves as a head-mounted sniper rifle, Dr. Hawkins had the perfect weapons suit at his disposal but there was one problem. Kurt was the only one who could wear it, due to the Doctor's age and Max's extra pair of legs.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490864\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-490864\"><img alt=\"Sniper view from within Kurt's helmet\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sniper view from within Kurt's helmet\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1070/490864-mdk21.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sniper view from within Kurt's helmet</figcaption></figure><p>So Kurt, begrudgingly, was dispatched on \"Mission: Deliver Kindness,\" entering the Minecrawlers from above, and destroying them from the inside-out.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Knytt Stories is an indie game consisting of shorter stories set in the Knytt universe. Only one story came with Knytt Stories when it was released: <i>\"The Machine\"</i>. However, four other official short stories have been released since then which can be downloaded at Nifflas' official homepage. Unlike its predecessor, <a href=\"/knytt/3030-19031/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19031\">Knytt</a>, which focused mainly on exploration, more skills are introduced in Knytt Stories. Players find various objects which allow fast running, climbing, longer jumps and a convenient umbrella which slows down falls, all of which are necessary to finish the stories.</p><h3>Story: The Machine</h3><p>In the story \"The Machine\" players play as Juni, a Knytt woman in a desolate land. One day Juni receives a letter from a friend saying that a machine is draining all the life from the world and that is why the planet is not green and flourishing. So Juni sets out to find this mysterious machine, but she will not be able to find it without certain objects that help her to get past otherwise impossible obstacles like long jumps.</p><h3>Story: An Underwater Adventure</h3><p>An Underwater Adventure tells the story of the Knytt girl who entered Dr. Cliché's laboratory, located on the ocean floor. It is the same laboratory from which the Ball from Within A Deep Forest escaped and subsequently returned to to cancel the countdown of a huge bomb explosion that would've crippled the planet. An Underwater Adventure tells another less-known version of the story, that the Ball never existed, but that it was the Knytt girl who defused the bomb and saved the world. When the story begins she's just been taken by her friend's sailing boat to a ventilation shaft sticking up from the water.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Knytt Stories can be played on a Nintendo DS by homebrewing it onto a memory card. (Which is endorsed by Nifflas himself)</li></ul>",

It was accepted into GameSpot's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-30.html/\">Greatest Games of All Time in 2003</a> and was rated the 150th best game on a <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> system by <i>Nintendo Power</i>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Not much of a plot exists in the actual game itself in ActRaiser. However, much is explained via the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet states that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1239\" href=\"/tanzra/3005-1239/\" slug=\"tanzra\">Tanzra</a> and his six guardians attacked the Master. The Master was injured after the long battle, so he retreated to his sky palace and proceeded to fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>While the Master was sleeping, Tanzra drove the world into ruins. He divided the world into six lands with each being ruled by one of the guardians. When the Master awakes, fully rejuvenated, he is ready to free the world from the oppression of Tanzra.</p><p>After defeating Tanzra, civilizations begin to stop worshiping the Master with many losing faith in him and turning to other things. The servant notes this, and says that people only appear to pray and trust to the Master in times of trouble.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In ActRaiser, the player takes control of an incredibly powerful being known only as the Master. The Master has been awakened from a deep sleep to find the world in ruin. He and his loyal servant (a small angelic creature) then set out to rebuild civilization.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389799\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389799\"><img alt=\"The Master takes the form of a warrior; here he is battling a boss\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The Master takes the form of a warrior; here he is battling a boss</figcaption></figure><p>To begin this rebuilding process, the Master positions his sky palace above an area filled with enemies and demons. Then, the Master takes on the form of a strong warrior wielding a large sword. In these side-scrolling areas, the warrior uses his sword to dispatch many hazards, such as environmental hazards or monsters. The warrior can pick up power-ups by destroying statues situated in certain places around the level. The power-ups have a variety of effects, from healing the warrior, to bonus points. After defeating the boss of the level, the warrior moves onto the next section of the city-building portion.</p><p>The life bar that the Master has in his warrior form can also be extended as the Master gains levels. Leveling up is done through an experience system, in which the combined population of the Master's rebuilt towns amasses into experience. Also gained in leveling up is more SP, which can then be used to preform miraculous events in the city-building part of the game. Magical spells can also be granted to the Master through his followers that he can use in his warrior form. These spells deal significantly more damage than regular attacks, making them essential to the completion of the game.</p><p>In the city-building portion of the game, the player takes control of the Master's servant, a small cupid-like creature. Each town begins with only two humans, who then follow the Master's commands and aid him in rebuilding his world. They must be guided (the direction they are guided in is where they will build), and in turn will build houses, roads, and farms. The villagers eventually gain use of other skills, such as composing music or creating bridges.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-464816\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-464816\"><img alt=\"Building a city\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Building a city\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Building a city</figcaption></figure><p>The Master also has the use of several magical powers in the city-building portion. He can summon lightning, rain, sun, wind, or earthquakes. Using these abilities, trees, rocks, snow, monsters, and much more can be cleared. In a few sections of the game, the abilities must be used to assist the villagers, starting windmills or putting out fires, for example.</p><p>However, the city-building isn't calm. There are several Monster Lairs scattered around the map. Monsters are spawned out of these lairs. The people have the ability to seal these lairs, making it a necessity to guide the population to the lairs. The cupid can attack the monsters using his arrows, but once he loses all of his life, he cannot attack until the people increase in population. Once all of the Monster Lairs are sealed, the people can gain even more advanced technology and techniques.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712890\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712890\"><img alt=\"Symphonic Suite from ActRasier\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Symphonic Suite from ActRasier\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Symphonic Suite from ActRasier</figcaption></figure><p>The critically acclaimed 16-bit soundtrack was composed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-5461\" href=\"/yuzo-koshiro/3040-5461/\" slug=\"yuzo-koshiro\">Yuzo Koshiro</a>.

It contained the following 10 tracks:</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><thead><tr><th><p>#</p></th><th><p>Track Name</p></th><th><p>Duration (30:40)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p><b>Opening ~ Tenkujo ~ Blood Pool ~ Casandora</b></p></td><td><p>4:20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p><b>Intermezzo I</b></p></td><td><p>0:18</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p><b>Filmoa</b></p></td><td><p>2:53</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p><b>Intermezzo II</b></p></td><td><p>0:31</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p><b>Aitos ~ Temple ~ Korin ~ Sekaiju</b></p></td><td><p>5:19</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p><b>Intermezzo III</b></p></td><td><p>0:20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p><b>Pyramid ~ Marana ~ Seijyaku ~ North Wall</b></p></td><td><p>5:56</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p><b>Hitobito no Tanjyo ~ Sasagemono</b></p></td><td><p>3:06</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p><b>Maju Arawaro ~ Kyoteki ~ Satan</b></p></td><td><p>3:18</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p><b>Heiwa na Sekai ~ Ending</b></p></td><td><p>4:39</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

The player is one of many different creatures created by <a href=\"../../gaia/94-2603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gaia</a>, the daughter of Sol the Sun, as they try to survive in a hostile, competitive world. As the story progresses, it transpires that the natural course of evolution on this planet is being toyed with by an unknown force. This force has begun to alter creatures using crystals to make them stronger and more likely to dominate the emerging web of flora and fauna.

At the beginning of each age, the player's creature changes drastically to a new form, becoming rather weak. Over the process of each age, defeated enemies drop \"<a data-ref-id=\"3055-267\" href=\"/meat/3055-267/\">meat</a>\" which can be eaten to regain <a data-ref-id=\"3015-130\" href=\"/health/3015-130/\">health</a> and gain EVO points. These EVO points can be spent to upgrade various parts of the body, with each part having several options to choose from. Each potential evolution has a required amount of EVO points to purchase, and is gained immediately when points are spent.</p><p>Body parts that can be evolved include:</p><ul><li>Jaws</li><li>Horns</li><li>Neck</li><li>Body</li><li>Hands and Feet</li><li>Dorsal Fin</li><li>Tail</li><li>Back of the Head</li></ul><p>Upgrades to each of these body parts give a variety of changes to the abilities of the player, from attack damage to health and defense. Each time that a large, story-related evolution is reached, however, all minor evolutions are lost and new ones must be purchased. The evolutions do not follow any set order, allowing the player to upgrade any part of the body to deal with an immediate threat or obstacle.</p><h3>Sales and critical reception</h3><p>The game was not released to much fanfare, but has generally been recognized as a work of high quality and became something a cult favorite years later.</p><p>Its fusion of side-scrolling and RPG gameplay was too repetitive for some, as players who enjoy the side-scrolling genre may not have been interested in the amount of character development normally associated with an RPG. Those willing to endure the occasional grind, however, appreciate the game's unique subject matter and use of evolution as a gamplay device.</p>",

Throughout the game, players follow the adventures of Simba, the main protagonist, and play through the same storyline as the film. The game consists of ten levels and two bonus levels, although some versions of the game were missing levels and various other features due to limitations of the hardware or software. The game received highly positive rankings and was considered \"one of the only good games based on a movie\".</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game is a linear platformer which has players going through level jumping, defeating enemies and solving an occasional light puzzle. On top of a classic style of jumping on enemies, Simba also has the ability to roar and cause different affects to foes. When Simba becomes an adult he gains the ability to slash and maul his foes. There is no save feature; losing all lives causes a restart of the game.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players control Simba, a young lion cub who faces much adversary after the death of his father (Mufasa) from the hands of his uncle, Scar. Simba gets tricked into believing that he his responsible for his father's death and is believed to be dead. He meets up with a meerkat and warthog and grows up in isolation outside of the Pride Lands. A wise monkey (Rafiki) gives him the ultimate power of speaking to the dead through drug-induced hallucination.This allows him to speak to his father who first he sees as his own reflection in a pond, he then looks to the sky as clouds form into his fathers image. Eventually he will return to Pride Rock to take his seat as king and avenge his father's death.</p><h2>Simba's World (Levels)</h2><ul><li>The Pridelands</li><li>Can't Wait to be King</li><li>The Elephant Graveyard</li><li>The Stampede</li><li>Simba's Exile</li><li>Hakuna Matata</li><li>Simba's Destiny</li><li>Be Prepared</li><li>Simba's Return</li><li>Pride Rock</li></ul><h3>Bonus Rounds</h3><ul><li>Bug Toss</li><li>Bug Hunt</li></ul>",

It is the first in a series of Sega-produced games starring <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/disney/3025-720/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-720\">Disney</a> mascot <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mickey-mouse/3025-535/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-535\">Mickey Mouse</a> (known as the \"Illusion\" series).</p><p>As <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mickey-mouse/3005-2363/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2363\">Mickey</a>, players must embark on an adventure through the evil and mysterious Castle of Illusion to rescue <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/minnie-mouse/3005-3199/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3199\">Minnie Mouse</a> from the evil witch Mizrabel, who plans to steal Minnie's youth. To do so, he must find the seven Gems of the Rainbow (guarded by the Masters of Illusion) hidden within the magical worlds (including an enchanted <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/forest/3035-1889/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1889\">forest</a> and a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/toy-box-stage/3015-2567/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2567\">toy-box</a>) scattered throughout the castle. The game's Practice difficulty changes the goal, in which Mickey must find three gems (collected by completing a particular level from the game's first three worlds) that would make Mizrabel see beauty in herself.</p><p>The game was later remade for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Sega Master System</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/game-gear/3045-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Sega Game Gear</a> throughout 1991, featuring redesigned levels and simplified graphics (as well as different enemies, items, and bosses), as well as completely changing one of Mickey's attacking mechanics from flinging apples (and other items previously collected) to picking up and hurling larger solid objects found throughout each level (such as indestructible barrels, which double as a <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzle mechanic</a>). The Game Gear version was a <a href=\"/launch-titles/3015-238/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-238\">launch title</a> in North America.</p><p>The original game was bundled with <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/quackshot-starring-donald-duck/3030-9412/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9412\">QuackShot starring Donald Duck</a> in Japan on October 15, 1998 as part of the Sega Ages series of game collections for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/saturn/3045-42/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Sega Saturn</a>. It also received <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/disney-castle-of-illusion-starring-mickey-mouse/3030-42342/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42342\">a full remake</a> on September 3, 2013 (almost 23 years after the original game's release) as a downloadable title for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sega-studios-australia/3010-8086/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8086\">Sega Studios Australia</a> (under supervision of the original game's director, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/emiko-yamamoto/3040-26756/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-26756\">Emiko Yamamoto</a>) featuring a variety of new gameplay mechanics (such as transitioning between 2D and 3D platforming) and a spoken narrator. The original game was released for the PlayStation 3 (for owners who pre-purchased the remake after August 20, 2013).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>As Mickey Mouse travels through these wacky and dangerous worlds, he will have to defeat a variety of enemies to advance. To attack enemies, Mickey can stomp on them, or fling apples and marbles at them, which can be collected throughout the game. Mickey Mouse can also collect icons that restore health, add extra lives, or boost the score.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>In Crash Bandicoot the lead protagonist, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-368\" href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3005-368/\">Crash</a>, must make his way through all of the games platforming challenges and boss fights to reach the lab of the Nefarious <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1289\" href=\"/doctor-neo-cortex/3005-1289/\">Doctor Neo Cortex</a>. If the player completes a level with all crates smashed and without losing a life, they are awarded with a Gem. Also if the player completes the level in the time trial they get another Gem for completing it under a certain time.</p><h2>Story</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-368\" href=\"/crash-bandicoot/3005-368/\">Crash Bandicoot</a> is kidnapped by the evil <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1289\" href=\"/doctor-neo-cortex/3005-1289/\">Dr. Neo Cortex</a> who has the intent of transforming the poor marsupial into an ultimate warrior for his army of super animal soldiers. This army was created, according to the games manual, to get back at those who made fun of Cortex in the past. Crash is disregarded as another failed attempt and manages to escape Cortex's clutches by jumping out of the window of Cortex Castle. As Crash Jumps Cortex's minions prepare Tawna Bandicoot, believed to be Crash's girlfriend, for experimentation. Crash washes up on the shore of N Sanity beach and must fight his way through three Islands in order to save Tawna from Cortex. Along the way Crash faces an array of bosses including the enraged <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11696\" href=\"/papu-papu/3005-11696/\">Papu Papu</a> and a host of Cortex's failed experiments including; <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12156\" href=\"/ripper-roo/3005-12156/\">Ripper Roo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11501\" href=\"/koala-kong/3005-11501/\">Koala Kong</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3980\" href=\"/pinstripe/3005-3980/\">Pinstripe Potroo</a>. As Crash nears Cortex Castle he faces Dr. N.Brio, Cortex's right hand man, and finally Cortex himself atop Cortex's blimp. As Cortex castle burns, Crash beats Cortex and he falls to his supposed demise. In the last shot of the game we see Crash and Tawna flying off into the sunset on a bird.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game has twenty-five normal platform levels, as well as two secret levels and six boss battles. The player must make their way through a limited environment whilst defeating enemies, avoiding pits and breaking crates, each of which contain some kind of bonus. Crash's only forms of attack are jumping and spinning. The majority of enemies can be defeated by using the jump attack, but enemies that cannot be defeated by the jump attack must be defeated by using the spinning move. This move can also be used to hit enemies into other enemies or crates. In some levels, Crash will ride a hog, which he has limited control over. In levels such as these, the player must avoid obstacles such as enemies while continuously going forward at fast speed on the hog. Some levels have the player being chased by a boulder, in which Bandicoot must run towards the screen while jumping over gaps.</p><h2>Items</h2><h3>Aku Aku</h3><p>The player can collect masks called <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1235\" href=\"/aku-aku/3005-1235/\">Aku Aku</a>. They help protect Crash against enemy attacks, collecting three of them gives temporary invulnerability.</p><h3>Lives</h3><p>The player can obtain icons in crates that depict Crash's face, these give him an extra life. Lives are more like a stock in that when Crash has one life left it means he has one extra go left, if you are at zero lives and die you will be taken to the game over screen</p><h3>Bonus Stage Icons</h3><p>These icons depict faces of Tawna, Cortex and Brio. If crash collects three matching icons in a level he is taken to a bonus stage.</p><h3><b>Wumpa Fruit</b></h3><p>Wumpa fruit are found throughout the adventure in crates, if Crash obtains 100 Wumpa fruit he is rewarded with an extra life and his Wumpa counter returns to zero.</p><h2><b>Structure</b></h2><p>Crash Bandicoot's journey is split into three large sections with roughly a third of the game happening on one of three Islands known loosely as the Wumpa Islands, named after the fruit that crash collects on his journey. The islands are sometimes known as <a data-ref-id=\"3035-137\" href=\"/n-sanity-island/3035-137/\">N.Sanity Islands</a> however this is more referential to the first of the three. The game never specifies where these islands are situated exactly with some reference to Australia and others to South America due to the Mayan ruins found littered on the islands.</p><h2><b>The First Island</b></h2><p>The First Island consists of a Native homeland, well away from the industrious Cortex, yet crash still faces challenges thrown at him by nature and angry tribesmen.</p><h3>Levels</h3><p><b>N.Sanity Beach</b> - Shows the basics of the game, Crash must fight crabs and turtles on his way into the Island.</p><p><b>Jungle Rollers</b> - Begins to ramp up the difficulty with moving obstacles, living plants and skunks.</p><p><b>The Great Gate</b> - Introduces a side scrolling style of platforming up a large Native wall, crash must avoid natives and monkeys as he travels.</p><p><b>Boulders</b> - The first level with the now trademark running from Boulder Crash Bandicoot level The camera is in front of Crash instead of behind so fast reactions are needed.</p><p><b>Upstream</b> - A level where there is no solid ground, if crash falls in the water he loses a life.</p><p><b>Papu Papu</b> - Boss, see below.</p><p><b>Rolling Stones</b> - A more complex level based off Jungle Rollers.</p><p><b>Hog Wild</b> - The first in another famous style of Crash level, Crash rides a boar who never stops so all crash can do is steer left and right throughout the level.</p><p><b>Native Fortress</b> - A more complex level in the style of The Great Gate.</p><h3>Bosses</h3><h3>Papu Papu</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7092/241195-papu_papu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-241195\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 450px\" data-ratio=\"1.2222222222222\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7092/241195-papu_papu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-241195\"><img alt=\"Papu Papu\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7092/241195-papu_papu.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7092/241195-papu_papu.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\" data-width=\"523\"></a><figcaption>Papu Papu</figcaption></figure><p>Papu Papu is the first boss in the game and therefore he is fairly easy to beat requiring only three hits. Papu Papu is not one of Cortex's animal warriors but is instead a rather territorial Chieftain of the Native N.Sanity Island tribe. He is an overweight human who's bad back leads to his downfall. The battle against Papu Papu takes place in his hut within a circular floor where Crash must dodge Papu Papu's attempts to hit him with a club.</p><h2>The Second Island</h2><p>The second Island is full of ancient ruins and dangerous animals The Island itself is centered around an enormous tree.</p><h3>Levels</h3><p><b>Up The Creek</b> - A more Complex level in the style of Upstream.</p><p><b>Ripper Roo</b> - Boss, see below.</p><p><b>The Lost City</b> - A side scrolling level set in the twilight hour of an ancient Mayan city, lizards and seesaw platforms await Crash here.</p><p><b>Temple Ruin</b>s - A level set in an ancient temple where there are few platforms above a dark abyss, Crash must avoid snakes and spears to proceed.</p><p><b>Road To Nowhere</b> - A level where Crash makes his way across uneven bridges above an endless drop some panels fall instantly, some after a while others are even made of ice!</p><p><b>Boulder Dash</b> - Another level where Crash must escape a moving boulder.

Ripper Roo is a Kangaroo who has been placed in a makeshift straight jacket though he still has control of his legs allowing him to jump large distances. Crash must jump the platforms atop the waterfall, minding where Roo himself jumps and time a large TNT explosion to coincide with Ripper Roo's jumping pattern.

The final battle takes place above Cortex Castle on top of the Zeppelin that Cortex owns. The battle is simple yet long, Crash must avoid all shots that Cortex fires until he fires a green shot. Here Crash must spin it back at cortex to damage him. The longer into the fight, the more green shots it takes to harm Cortex. Upon defeat Cortex plummets towards the island landing in the area of the Lights out level, this has significance in the next game in the series.</p><h2>Secrets</h2><h3>Secret Levels/Areas</h3><p>There are two secret levels in the game being 'Whole Hog' and 'Fumbling in the Dark' These two levels are obtained by acquiring a key in the levels before them. In order to complete the game 100% the gems must be collected from these levels. Some level gems are special and unlock extra paths that weren't accessible before in previous levels. These path's will award the player in some way, by allowing them to bypass a level or acquire a vast amount of lives.</p><h3>100% Complete</h3><p>The level before the final boss is called the Great Hall and appears to contain no challenge at all, but if the player has acquired every Gem in the game, including the ones from the secret levels, then a pathway of gems emerge and the player can follow this trail to bypass the last boss and find the 100% complete ending. In this ending Tawna has found a large bird which her and Crash escape on, what happens to Cortex is unknown and it is likely that this ending is not the canonical one. This ending also has an epilogue where we are told what the characters did after the game, again a lot of these clash with the events of the second game, this ending is non-canon.</p><h3>Bonus Levels</h3><p>During most levels Crash could find the faces of either Tawna, N.Brio or Cortex hidden in crates throughout the level, If he gained three matching faces then access to a bonus stage was unlocked, if Crash could complete the level then the player got the option to save or get a password for their current progress.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The game was created as the brainchild of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-827\" href=\"/naughty-dog-inc/3010-827/\">Naughty Dog's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3040-19167\" href=\"/jason-rubin/3040-19167/\">Jason Rubin</a> and Andy Gavin, Crash went through various stages in design, some pictured below.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658786-crash_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658786\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 450px\" data-ratio=\"1.3066666666667\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658786-crash_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658786\"><img alt=\"Early Crash Ideation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\" data-width=\"489\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658786-crash_03.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658786-crash_03.gif 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Early Crash Ideation\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658786-crash_03.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658786-crash_03.gif 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\" data-width=\"489\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Early Crash Ideation</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658787-crash_01.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658787\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 450px\" data-ratio=\"1.2533333333333\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658787-crash_01.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658787\"><img alt=\"Early Crash Ideation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-width=\"510\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658787-crash_01.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658787-crash_01.gif 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Early Crash Ideation\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658787-crash_01.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658787-crash_01.gif 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-width=\"510\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Early Crash Ideation</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658785-crash_02.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658785\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 450px\" data-ratio=\"1.2311111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658785-crash_02.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-658785\"><img alt=\"Early Crash Ideation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" data-width=\"519\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658785-crash_02.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658785-crash_02.gif 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Early Crash Ideation\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658785-crash_02.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3357/658785-crash_02.gif 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" data-width=\"519\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Early Crash Ideation</figcaption></figure><p>Jason Rubin was under the idea that everyone loved to smash things and thus the idea that crash would spin and break creates was thought up.</p><h3>Music</h3><p>The Music was created by music group, Mutato Musika who wrote the music for all future Naughty Dog games except for the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-957\" href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\">Uncharted</a> franchise. The music differed a little for the Japanese version of the game, where Sony Executives wanted boss music and bonus level music to be more ' video game like'.</p><h3>Intention</h3><p>To Naughty Dog, Crash Bandicoot was a way of showing how proficient they were with using the technology of the Playstation hardware and their artistic minds. The game was quickly funded by Sony Computer entertainment who saw Crash Bandicoot as their very own <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\">Mario</a>. The game was published by Universal. It can be argued that Crash Bandicoot had certain environmental messages within the game with the nature versus pollution theme running throughout the game, it is not known whether this was wholly intentional or not.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>Crash Bandicoot's reception was mainly positive with game critics, The game has an 80.4% on Game Rankings after many positive reviews. The game got a negative review from some who compared it's linear paths to more free roaming aspects found in games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\" href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\">Super Mario 64.</a></p><p>The game was still praised for its graphics, when the game was re released on the PSN in 2007 IGN praised it for still looking impressive.</p><p>Crash Bandicoot was a definite commercial success and it's success brought about two sequels and a Kart racer by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-827\" href=\"/naughty-dog-inc/3010-827/\">Naughty Dog</a>, During the Playstation era, Crash was portrayed as Sony's mascot character.</p>",

This time around, an evil sorceress, her army of Rynocs, and apprentice, Bianca, have stolen the eggs. Spyro and his friends are the only ones who can retrieve the eggs, and stop the Sorceress' goals. As Spyro pursues the thieves responsible, he discovers a realm, called Avalon, which was once a home for dragons, but is now the place where the Sorceress resides. Spyro visits each forgotten realm to retrieve the eggs, with the help of different playable characters (<a href=\"/sheila/3005-10365/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10365\">Sheila</a>, <a href=\"/sgt-bird/3005-3955/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3955\">Sgt.

It is later revealed that the Sorceress is planning to use the wings of the baby dragons to create an immortality potion. This new facet of information forces Bianca to change sides and aid Spyro in stopping her. Spyro is finally able to kill the sorceress, and deliver all the baby dragons to the Dragon Kingdom.</p><h2>Homeworld and Levels</h2><p>The game spans four homeworlds which act as stations to other portals. Each Homeworld contains eight portals to separate levels: four standard levels, a speedway, a freed character from <a href=\"/moneybags/3005-10352/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10352\">Moneybags</a>' level, a boss confrontation, and a Sparx level.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Ape Escape is an action/adventure game developed by <a href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony Computer Entertainment America</a>. The object of the game is to battle and capture monkeys that have gone rampant. It is also the first game to require the DualShock controller, for it needed the use of both thumb sticks.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>The whole point of the game is to stop Specter and his evil monkeys. Spike's mission is to stun the monkeys with any combination of his items, and then capture them with the gadget known as the Time Net. This net captures the monkeys and sends them back to the present. More Gadgets would be given to Spike as the player progresses through the game. The available Gadgets are:</p><ul><li><b>Time Net -</b> The only Gadget that can capture monkeys (on land). Swing the right analog stick to swing the net.</li><li><b>Stun Club - </b>A lightsaber-like Gadget that stuns monkeys, and also harms various other enemies. Swing the right analog stick to swing the club.</li><li><b>Water Net -</b> The only Gadget that can be used underwater. It is automatically switched to when Spike is in water, and can shoot out nets to capture monkeys.</li><li><b>Monkey Radar -</b> A radar that is used to find monkeys. The closer Spike is to a monkey, the faster and higher-pitched the sound it emits will be. Once close enough, the camera can zoom in on the monkey and display a little bio. Rotating the right analog stick rotates the radar dish.</li><li><b>Slingback Shooter/Slingshot -</b> A slingshot that stuns monkeys. Can also harm enemies and hit buttons. Can shoot 3 different types of pellets: Normal, Guided, or Explosive. Pull back on the right analog stick to aim, and let go to shoot.</li><li><b>Super Hoop/Dash Hoop </b>- A hula hoop that gives Spike a speed boost, also allowing him to bowl over enemies. Spin the right analog stick to spin and charge the hoop. Once charged, let go of the stick to activate the boost.</li><li><b>Sky Flyer -</b> A little handheld propeller that allows Spike to rise up in the air. Spin the right analog stick to spin the Sky Flyer, and give Spike lift. Continuous spinning will not keep Spike airborne, but it will slow his descent.</li><li><b>RC Car -</b> A remote controlled car that can fit through small holes. Used to hit unreachable buttons, or to draw monkeys out of hiding. The right analog stick controls the car.</li><li><b>Magic Punch -</b> Obtainable after defeating Specter. An extendable device with what appears to be a boxing glove at the end, it is a powerful Gadget that can destroy boxes and walls that the Stun Club cannot. Tilt the right analog stick slightly for a weak punch, all the way for a strong one.</li></ul><p>Each of the gadgets has its own training room which must be completed to obtain it. These rooms can also be accessed in the warp room.</p><h3>Monkeys</h3><p>Each monkey has different characteristics and requires different tactics to capture them. For example, some monkeys are sleepy, which allows for an easy capture, while some are energetic, requiring the player to run around after them. Some are aggressive, which means that just running up to them could get Spike furiously punched, and some simply threw banana peels to make him slip. Some even carry firearms. Items have to be used in certain combinations in order to have the monkeys either be backed into a corner or become available to capture. Spike can also try going for a stealth approach. The lights on their helmets signify their statuses:</p><ul><li><b>Blue</b> - The monkey is calm. Nothing is amiss.</li><li><b>Yellow</b> - The monkey is suspicious and is on alert.</li><li><b>Red</b> - The monkey is alerted to Spike, and will attempt to run away and/or fight back.</li></ul><p>The color of a monkey's pants determines what type of monkey it is. Different strategies are required to catch different monkeys.</p><ul><li><b>Yellow - </b>Regular monkey. They can hit Spike, throw bananas to make him slip and sometimes they carry a gun.</li><li><b>Red -</b> Strong attacker. They fire rockets at Spike and also carry machine guns.</li><li><b>Blue</b> - Fast runner. They run really quickly. The dash hoop/super hoop is used to chase them.</li><li><b>White</b> - Great balance. They don't fall over easily.</li><li><b>Green</b> - Great vision. They fire rockets at Spike and are vigilant. They also wear 3D glasses.</li><li><b>Black</b> - Dangerous and wild. They wear black shades and have machine guns.</li><li><b>Light Blue</b> - Timid and gentle. Similar to a yellow monkey but less aggressive.</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p>There once was a monkey named Specter, who happily performed for humans at the zoo. But one day, the Professor accidentally drops one of his inventions, the Peak Point Helmet (Pipo Helmet). Due to curiosity, Specter tries the helmet on, and gains vast amounts of intelligence, and psychic powers. Now believing that humans treat monkeys cruelly, the megalomaniac Specter vows revenge on humans. He amasses an army of monkeys equipped with similar intelligence-boosting helmets (though less powerful than his own), and storms The Professor's lab. He plans to use the Professor's time machine to go back in time, and make monkeys the dominant species on the planet, instead of humans. Just then, Spike and his friend Jake/Buzz barge into the lab, right before Specter makes the leap back in time. He manages to go back in time anyways, as well as kidnapping Jake/Buzz and turning him into a mind-controlled slave. Aided by the Professor, his assistant/granddaughter Natalie/Katie, and his various gadgets, Spike must now go back in time to save Jake/Buzz, round up the rebellious monkeys, and stop Specter from changing history.</p><h2>Controls</h2><p>Since the game requires the DualShock controller, it allows for a very unique control scheme (for its time). The character is moved with the left thumb stick, and attacks are done with the right stick. The R button is used to jump. The face buttons allow the character to select from a large variety of weapons, everything ranging from a laser sword to a remote controlled car. Attacks are done by moving the right stick in the desired direction. There are also certain weapons that require the attack stick to be spun around quickly, such as a electric hula hoop that once spun fast enough will shoot the player forward quickly. This control scheme was incredibly innovative at the time and made the game much more immersive because it allowed the player to feel like they were much more involved in using the items in the game.</p><h2>Mini Games</h2><p>There are 3 mini games available to unlock in the warp room, each of which is unlocked after collecting a certain amount of Specter Tokens.They all make use of the thumb sticks in unique ways.They are:</p><h3>Ski Kidz Racing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262159\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262159\"><img alt=\" Spike skiing.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg 450w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Spike skiing.</figcaption></figure><p>A racing game where the characters take to the slopes for a skiing race.

A split-screen mode is also available. 20 specter tokens are needed to unlock it.</p><h3>Galaxy Monkey</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468091\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5583596214511\" data-width=\"634\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 634px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468091\"><img alt=\" Pigs in space?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg 634w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Pigs in space?\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg 634w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44475/1468091-monkey_galaxy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Pigs in space?</figcaption></figure><p>A dual joystick shooter that features a UFO.

There is a co-op mode as well as a 3 minute time attack mode. 40 Specter tokens are required to unlock it.</p><p> </p><h2>PSP Port</h2><p>In 2005, an updated port of Ape Escape titled <a href=\"/ape-escape-on-the-loose/3030-7961/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7961\">Ape Escape: On the Loose</a> was released for the PSP. It had quite a few control differences, including being able to have only three items at the ready with the Triangle, Circle, and Square buttons as opposed to four on the original version. It changed the title of the level \"Wabi Sabi Wall\" to \"Tiki Tiki Wall\". Also instead of a skiing minigame, it was changed to a snowboarding minigame due to a lack of a second analog stick.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>The levels in Ape Escape are divided into different time zones.</p><h3>The Lost Land</h3><ul><li>Fossil Fields</li><li>Wetlands</li><li>Dinosaur Area</li></ul><h3>Mysterious age</h3><ul><li>Thick Jungle</li><li>Mysterious Ruins 1</li><li>Mysterious Ruins 2</li></ul><h3>Primative Ocean</h3><ul><li>Crabby Beach</li><li>Coral Cave</li><li>Dexter's Island</li></ul><h3>Ice Age</h3><ul><li>Snowy Mammoth</li><li>Frosty Retreat</li><li>Monkey Hot Springs</li></ul><h3>Medieval Mayhem</h3><ul><li>Sushi Temple</li><li>Wabi Sabi Wall</li><li>Crumbling Castle</li></ul><h3>Futurama</h3><ul><li>City Park</li><li>Specter's Factory</li><li>TV Tower</li></ul><h3>Present Day</h3><ul><li>Specter Land</li><li>Final Get</li></ul>",

The game combines all the stages from Super Monkey Ball and <a href=\"/super-monkey-ball-2/3030-5122/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5122\">Super Monkey Ball 2</a> into one package and adds a bunch of new stages. The mini-games, too, were carried over from the first games and expanded to include never-before-seen mini-games.</p><p>The concept of the game is rather simple; the player is a monkey inside a ball. Move the right analogue stick in a certain direction and the monkey begins to roll, get the monkey through the goal at the end of each level and the player moves onto the next.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Freedom Planet is a 2D side scrolling platformer developed and published by <a href=\"/galaxytrail-games/3010-8178/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8178\">GalaxyTrail Games</a>. It is heavily inspired by the classic <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3025-383/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-383\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> games but is so is also reminiscent of other <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Sega Genesis/Mega Drive</a> games. The game features two modes of play, Adventure mode and Classic Mode. Adventure Mode offers the same gameplay as Classic Mode but includes a large amount of cutscenes and story that are fully voice acted and animated, Classic Mode is for players who strictly want to play the game. Freedom Planet stars three young ladies as playable characters, <a href=\"/sash-lilac/3005-32106/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32106\">Lilac</a> the dragon, <a href=\"/carol-tea/3005-32107/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32107\">Carol</a> the wildcat and <a href=\"/milla-basset/3005-32108/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32108\">Milla</a> the basset hound.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player controls one of three characters, Lilac, Carol, or Milla, and must platform across levels and battle robot enemies that get in the way. The levels contain loop-the-loops, corkscrews, spring pads and other obstacles and mechanisms that help and hinder the player. Some levels have gates that require special actions in order to pass through, like destroying a crystal or finding a key. Each level has a mini-boss, located about half way through the level and a boss at the end of the level.</p><p>The player is allowed to take damage and it is gauged by petals that act as hit points, this meter is located in the upper left corner. Lilac has seven health petals, Carol also has seven health petals and Milla only has health four petals. If the player looses all health petals then a life is lost, lives are indicated in the upper left corner as well. Players can also get shield power-ups, these have different properties based on what color of crystal is smashed. Green is a wood shield, yellow is an earth shield, blue is a water shield, red is a fire shield, silver is a metal shield and rainbow grants invincibility.</p><p>Each character has some basic attacks as well as a special attack that is unique to them. The basic attacks change based on the direction being held when the attack button is pushed, they are similar between characters. The special attack is more powerful but depletes the special meter, the meter must refill in order to use the special again, it is located in the upper left corner. Lilac has an air dash, Carol has a rapid kick move and Milla throws a gelatinous energy cube. The characters also have other special characteristics differentiating their play style. Lilac has a double jump, Carol can cling to walls and ride a motorcycle and Milla can fly temporarily by flapping her ears.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The ruthless Lord Brevon crash lands on the planet Avalice, he soon learns of a powerful gemstone, the Kingdom stone, that is powering the three local cities. In order to repair his spacecraft he devises a plan to trick the three cities into fighting with one another so he can steal the Kingdom Stone without there interference and repair his ship. Meanwhile another spacecraft crash lands on Avalice containing Torque the Shellduck. Torque is rescued from the crash by two young ladies, Lilac and Carol who are on there way to see the Kingdom Stone. Torque informs them of Lord Brevons evil ways and the group decides they must protect the Kingdom Stone and thwart Lord Brevon's plans.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The project was conceived by game designer and programmer Steven DiDuro who founded GalaxyTrail games to create the project. It was originally designed to be a Sonic fan project and included Doctor Robotnik/Eggman as the villain and a ring based health system but it was decided it would only limit the project.</p><p>A demo for Freedom Planet was initially posted on <a href=\"http://galaxytrail.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GalaxyTrail's website</a> in 2012 as a proof of concept. The project was then <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galaxytrail/freedom-planet-high-speed-platform-game\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Kickstarted</a> on January 15, 2013 where it raised $25,472 from 1,105 backers. The title was also placed into Steam Greenlight a day later and was officially Greenlit in August of 2013. The project was officially released around a year later on July 21, 2014. Freedom Planet was announced to release on the Wii U on March, 8 2015, no official date has been scheduled for that release.</p>",

Unlike other platformers, Sonic's speed gives him the momentum to traverse through these environments at a fast pace, though most levels are built in a way to limit that to promote exploration, and even the time travel mechanic is often used as an obstacle to hinder the player.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-938143\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-938143\"><img alt=\"Sonic using his Super Peel-Out technique to enter a loop at a very fast speed.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonic using his Super Peel-Out technique to enter a loop at a very fast speed.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/938143-sonic_the_hedgehog_cd021.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic using his Super Peel-Out technique to enter a loop at a very fast speed.</figcaption></figure><p>The player moves Sonic left and right using the directional pad and jumps using any Jump button. Holding up on the d-pad lets Sonic look up (temporarily shifting the screen upwards) while holding down on the d-pad lets Sonic crouch (temporarily shifting the screen downwards if held down long enough) Crouching while moving causes him to curl up into a ball (known as the Super Spin Attack), reducing his friction against the ground while allowing him to destroy most enemies (whereas running into them will damage Sonic instead). Jumping also curls him up into a ball, allowing him to destroy most enemies whenever airborne. The Jump button can also be used in certain levels for interacting with objects (such as the <a href=\"/pinball-flippers/3055-537/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-537\">pinball flippers</a> in Collision Chaos Zone).</p><p>Sonic has two techniques that allow him to instantly gain momentum from a fixed position. The first, returning somewhat from <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, is the Spin Dash (known in Sonic CD as the Super Spin Dash), which is performed by holding down on the d-pad and pressing the Jump button. After releasing the d-pad, Sonic moves forward (in a speed determined by how long the d-pad was held) while doing his Super Spin Attack. The second technique is the Super Peel-Out, which is performed by holding up on the d-pad and pressing the Jump button. The Super Peel-Out is the same as the Super Spin Dash, except that it propels Sonic faster at the cost of his Super Spin Attack (causing him to be vulnerable to enemies).</p><p>Hitting most enemies while not performing one of the Spin Attacks (or hitting certain enemies and hazards regardless) causes Sonic to do both of two things: Lose all of his possessed rings (but allow him to re-collect some of the rings that fell out of him this way) and stun him momentarily, or (if he does not have any rings in his possession) lose a <a href=\"/lives/3015-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">life</a> and begin again from a checkpoint. However, the player immediately loses a life every time he is crushed between moving objects, falls down the bottom of the level (which is rare in Sonic CD), <a href=\"/drowning/3015-2135/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2135\">drowned</a> underwater (spending a lot of time underwater without touching large <a href=\"/bubble/3055-497/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-497\">air bubbles</a>), and spends more than ten minutes in the current life on the current stage. If Sonic loses all of his lives, it's <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">Game Over</a>. Sonic begins the game with three lives, and can earn lives by either collecting <a href=\"/1-up/3055-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-77\">1-Up</a> power-ups, collecting 100 rings, or earning 50,000 points.</p><p>As a hidden <a href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2\">easter egg</a>, an instant Game Over can occur if the player leaves Sonic idle (and unpaused) for more than three minutes at one time (in which Sonic says \"I'm outta here!\" and leaps off the screen).</p><p> </p><h3>Time Travel</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-299128\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6992125984252\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-299128\"><img alt=\"Destroy these robot teleporters to save the future!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg 635w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Destroy these robot teleporters to save the future!\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg 635w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12813/299128-sonic_cd5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Destroy these robot teleporters to save the future!</figcaption></figure><p>Sonic CD is the only game in the original series to include the concept of <a href=\"/time-travel/3015-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-73\">time travel</a> as an in-game mechanic. By passing a signpost marked \"PAST\" or \"FUTURE\", Sonic would be charged with mysterious energy. The ''PAST'' or ''FUTURE'' symbol at this point appears on the bottom of the screen. While in possession of this signpost, if Sonic could maintain a high-level speed for several seconds (which is difficult to accomplish intentionally, as losing that momentum at any point for the last few seconds after attaining would cause Sonic to lose the energy <i>and</i> the sign), he would be whisked off to a different time era, featuring a permutated version of the same level. The level may include new obstacles, enemies, and puzzles. There are four permutations for each stage:</p><ul><li><b>Present</b> - The default era for the first two stages of each Zone. Includes both \"PAST\" and \"FUTURE\" signposts and non-functioning \"robot teleporters\".</li></ul><ul><li><b>Past</b> - A primitive-looking version of the stage. Includes only \"FUTURE\" signposts, functioning \"robot teleporters\" (which can be destroyed, saving the future of that stage and causing all enemies in the Past to disappear), and functioning holograms of Metal Sonic tormenting animals (which can also be destroyed).</li></ul><ul><li><b>Bad Future</b> - A ruined dystopia (which <a href=\"/dr-robotnik/3005-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-293\">Dr. Robotnik</a> rules) that is the default era for the third stage of each Zone (assuming the player did not destroy the \"robot teleporter\" in each of the two preceding stages). Bad Future can be accessed in other stages if the player travels to the future and did not destroy the \"robot teleporter\" in the past. Includes only \"PAST\" signposts.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Good Future</b> - A shining utopia with minimal enemies and obstacles. The default era for the third stage of each Zone (if the player destroyed both \"robot teleporters\" in the preceding stages). Can be accessed in other stages if the player travels to the future and did destroy the \"robot teleporter\" in the past. Includes only \"PAST\" signposts.</li></ul><p>If either all fourteen \"robot teleporters\" are destroyed or the player collecting all seven Time Stones in the special stages, then the player receives a \"good ending\" at the end of the game. Otherwise, the player receives a \"bad ending\". Destroying all fourteen holograms of Metal Sonic shows a hidden congratulation at the end of the game.</p><p> </p><h3>Special Stages</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/545087-specialstage2shot1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545087\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/545087-specialstage2shot1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545087\"><img alt=\"Sonic running towards a UFO in a special stage.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/545087-specialstage2shot1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/545087-specialstage2shot1.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonic running towards a UFO in a special stage.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/545087-specialstage2shot1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12813/545087-specialstage2shot1.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic running towards a UFO in a special stage.</figcaption></figure><p>If Sonic crosses a goalpost with 50 rings held, the player can choose to play a special stage by letting Sonic jump into a giant golden ring close to the goalpost. Special stages are three-dimensional <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> courses in which Sonic (shown in third-person perspective) must run around and collide with six flying <a href=\"/ufo/3055-611/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-611\">UFOs</a> (usually by jumping) in a limited amount of time while avoiding time-consuming obstacles.</p><p>Each of the six UFOs, when destroyed, grant Sonic either a group of coins (for scoring purposes) or a Power Sneaker powerup, allowing Sonic to run faster through the course for a short period of time. If the time dwindles down to 20 seconds, a blue UFO appears near the center of the course which, if destroyed, grants Sonic 30 extra seconds.</p><p>Each of the seven courses are filled with different terrain that either help or hinder Sonic's progress. Grass and rough patches of gravel, for example, slow down Sonic. Water not only slows Sonic down, but increases the rate at which the timer goes down (as well as take away 10 seconds on each landing on the water). Fans slowly propel Sonic upwards (allowing him to take out UFOs easier) while springs quickly propel Sonic upwards (allowing him to reach a farther distance quicker).

Both features lyrics by Casey Rankin and vocals by Keiko Utoku. The primer one is used at the game's introduction sequence and the latter one is used at the game's ending sequence. The 2011 enhanced port uses an instrumental version of these themes.</p><p>The main theme for the American soundtrack is \"Sonic Boom\" by Spencer Nilsen, featuring vocals by Pastiche.

His parent company, <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega of Japan</a>, paid its employees based on their seniority - those who worked at the company longer got paid more than the new recruits, and in the grand scheme of things Naka was still considered fairly new, despite having been a key figure in launching one of Sega's biggest franchises. He quit his job at Sega of Japan - but not before being lured to Sega of America by <a href=\"/mark-cerny/3040-18965/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-18965\">Mark Cerny</a>. Mark Cerny was part of the \" <a href=\"/sega-technical-institute/3010-1391/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1391\">Sega Technical Institute</a>\", a program/development team whose ultimate goal was to bring overseas developers in to impart their wisdom to the relatively inexperienced American designers. With Naka came a number of other key <a href=\"/sonic-team/3010-781/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-781\">Sonic Team</a> staff, and it was here at Sega Technical Institute that groundwork was laid for <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> - a game that was to be much larger in scope than the original Sonic, with nearly three times as many levels, two playable characters, split-screen multiplayer, and a <a href=\"/time-travel/3015-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-73\">time travel</a> mechanic.</p><p>Back on the other side of the globe, the original character designer for Sonic and Dr. Eggman, <a href=\"/naoto-ohshima/3040-17690/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-17690\">Naoto Ohshima</a>, was offered the opportunity to make his own Sonic 2 at Sega of Japan for their up-and-coming hardware add-on, the <a href=\"/sega-cd/3045-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-29\">Sega CD</a>. Given that the majority of Sonic Team was in America working on Sonic 2, Ohshima had to assemble his own team out of Sega of Japan's roster of designers, lending the game a unique flavor separate from the Sega Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. Ohshima and his Japan team took the concept of time travel and ran with it, developing a gameplay mechanic around traveling back in to the past in order to alter the status of the future.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/2087249-6359622455_cce7197f1c_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2087249\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.674\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/2087249-6359622455_cce7197f1c_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2087249\"><img alt=\"Sonic CD concept art for \"Metal Sonic\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/2087249-6359622455_cce7197f1c_b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/2087249-6359622455_cce7197f1c_b.jpg 1000w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1486/2087249-6359622455_cce7197f1c_b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/2087249-6359622455_cce7197f1c_b.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonic CD concept art for \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic CD concept art for \"Metal Sonic\"</figcaption></figure><p>Whereas Sonic 2 introduced Tails, Sonic CD introduced <a href=\"/amy-rose/3005-948/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-948\">Amy Rose</a> and <a href=\"/metal-sonic/3005-2273/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2273\">Metal Sonic</a>, brought to life by <a href=\"/kazuyuki-hoshino/3040-33659/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33659\">Kazuyuki Hoshino</a>; his first job in what would become a long lasting relationship with Sonic Team.

The game was originally intended to launch shortly after the original Sonic the Hedgehog, but Sega felt it was more important to release Sonic the Hedgehog 2 first, delaying the fully-completed Sonic CD almost a full year beyond its originally intended launch date, instead using the game to fill the gap between Sonic 2 and <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/3030-4628/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4628\">Sonic 3</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2087246\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2087246\"><img alt=\"Whitehead's \"Desert Dazzle\" concept art.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/2087246-lxkcq.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Whitehead's \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Whitehead's \"Desert Dazzle\" concept art.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Putting a Sonic CD disc in to a PC CD-ROM drive reveals at least one level was cut from the game's level roster. The data for each level in the game is organized by numbered folders, starting at \"r1\" up to \"r8\". However, the \"r2\" folder is missing, jumping from \"r1\" directly to \"r3\". Clues regarding what this stage may have looked like are hidden all over the game; the \"Little Planet\" artwork used on some loading screens features a cactus-filled desert region that is never actually seen in-game, and the extended version of the credits video showcases Sonic leaping through dilapidated ruins before confronting a giant Ant-lion robot, similar in appearance to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Sega <a href=\"/game-gear/3045-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear</a>. In Christian Whitehead's 2011 remake of Sonic CD, he was originally going to include a level based on this lost \"r2\" concept named \"Desert Dazzle\", but Sonic Team felt it would be better if the game stayed true to the original Sega CD release.</li><li>Upon entering the game's \"Debug Mode\" Cheat Code, you see artwork of <a href=\"/tails/3005-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-45\">Miles \"Tails\" Prower</a> standing next to a jeep with the text, \"See you next game - Judy Totoya\". Judy Totoya was a pen name sometimes used by Yasushi Yamaguchi, original character designer for Tails. \"See you next game\" is in reference to the game's original, \"before Sonic 2\" release date. In Christian Whitehead's Sonic CD update, this \"See you next game\" artwork is displayed when the player unlocks the ability to play as Tails.</li><li>In an effort to tie Sonic CD to the upcoming wave of Sonic the Hedgehog comic books and TV shows, Sega of America renamed Amy Rose in the original English Sonic CD game manual to \"Princess Sally\". This was later retconned by the aforementioned Archie comic books, who restored her name back to Amy Rose.</li><li>The character of Amy Rose is most likely derived from the Japanese Shogaku Yonensei Sonic the Hedgehog Manga. It featured a mild-mannered hedgehog named Nicky who would turn in to the super hero \"Sonic\" when his friends were in danger. Nicky's girlfriend was named Amy.</li></ul>",

Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3025-383/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-383\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> franchise, the game remasters a level from certain mainline Sonic games (<a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, and <a href=\"/sonic-knuckles/3030-18115/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18115\">Sonic &amp; Knuckles</a> for the \"Classic\" era; <a href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure</a>, <a href=\"/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19060\">Sonic Adventure 2</a>, and <a href=\"/sonic-heroes/3030-9523/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9523\">Sonic Heroes</a> for the \"Adventure\" era; and <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20584\">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a>, <a href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\">Sonic Unleashed</a>, and <a href=\"/sonic-colors/3030-31428/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31428\">Sonic Colors</a> for the \"Modern\" era), in which players run through each stage in two ways: in classic 2D perspective as Classic Sonic, and in modern 3D perspective as Modern Sonic.</p><p>The story, set sometime after the events of Sonic Colors, has <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic</a> and his friends being sucked into various \"time holes\" by a mysterious new being, scattering them into different places in history. As Sonic is thrown back to his early days in <a href=\"/green-hill-zone/3035-144/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-144\">Green Hill Zone</a>, he encounters a younger, less talkative self (known in the game as Classic Sonic). Together, they must rescue their friends (including a younger Classic Tails) and find out the true mastermind behind the mysterious Time Eater.</p><p>The game features unlockables (such as concept artwork) and references to the 90s era of Sega games. A playable version of the original Sonic the Hedgehog is also unlockable for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay is broken up between two versions of Sonic. The 1990's-era-based \"Classic Sonic\" sees levels from a strictly side-scrolling perspective, with many of the game mechanics being pulled directly from the series' 16-bit heritage. \"Modern Sonic\" on the other hand borrows more heavily from games like the <a href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\">Sonic Unleashed titles</a> and <a href=\"/sonic-colors/3030-31428/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31428\">Sonic Colors Wii</a>, with boost-focused gameplay punctuated by perspective shifts between side-scrolling and behind-the-back 3D. A 2D <a href=\"/hub-world/3015-1855/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\">hub world</a> exists between stages, allowing players to pick between levels by walking up to that stage in the environment and cycling through a menu of available \"Acts\".</p><p>Though \"Classic Sonic\" and \"Modern Sonic\" are the only playable characters, after completing the main two acts of a stage, Sonic rescues one of Sonic's many friends, who hang around in the hub world and challenge Sonic to complete optional side missions. Each act has 10 challenges attached to it (5 as \"Classic Sonic\", 5 as \"Modern Sonic\"). Beating these will unlock additional music and artwork, as well as restore that particular hub area back to normal by returning color to it.</p><h2>Xbox 360/Playstation 3/PC Zones</h2><p>Each zone includes a main act for both Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic. Essentially, <i>Sonic Generations</i> features 9 Classic Sonic stages and 9 Modern Sonic stages, not counting side acts and boss encounters.</p><p>Each zone and boss is based on a level or boss from a previous Sonic title. As coinciding with the anniversary theme of Sonic Generations, the player is essentially taken on a tour through 20 years of Sonic's history.</p><h4>\"Classic Era\" Stages</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\"><b>Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)</b></a>: <a href=\"/green-hill-zone/3035-144/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-144\">Green Hill Zone</a></li><li><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\"><b>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</b></a>: <a href=\"/chemical-plant-zone/3035-839/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-839\">Chemical Plant Zone</a></li><li><b><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/3030-4628/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4628\">Sonic</a> <a href=\"/sonic-knuckles/3030-18115/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18115\">and Knuckles</a></b>: <a href=\"/sky-sanctuary-zone/3035-4116/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4116\">Sky Sanctuary Zone</a></li><li><b>Boss</b>: <a href=\"/death-egg/3035-3884/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3884\">Death Egg</a> Robot / <a href=\"/death-egg/3035-3884/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3884\">Death Egg</a> Zone (<a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\">Sonic The Hedgehog 2</a>)</li><li><b>Rival</b>: <a href=\"/metal-sonic/3005-2273/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2273\">Metal Sonic</a> / Stardust Speedway Bad Future ( <a href=\"/sonic-cd/3030-14433/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14433\">Sonic CD</a>)</li></ul><h4>\"Adventure Era\" Stages</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\"><b>Sonic Adventure</b></a>: Speed Highway</li><li><a href=\"/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19060\"><b>Sonic Adventure 2</b></a>: City Escape</li><li><a href=\"/sonic-heroes/3030-9523/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9523\"><b>Sonic Heroes</b></a>: Seaside Hill</li><li><b>Boss</b>: <a href=\"/chaos/3005-2918/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2918\">Perfect Chaos</a> / <a href=\"/station-square/3035-426/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-426\">Station Square</a> ( <a href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure</a>)</li><li><b>Rival</b>: <a href=\"/shadow-the-hedgehog/3005-811/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-811\">Shadow the Hedgehog</a> / <a href=\"/space-colony-ark/3035-846/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-846\">Space Colony ARK</a> ( <a href=\"/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19060\">Sonic Adventure 2</a>)</li></ul><h4>\"Modern Era\" Stages</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20584\"><b>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</b></a>: Crisis City</li><li><a href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\"><b>Sonic Unleashed</b></a>: Rooftop Run</li><li><a href=\"/sonic-colors/3030-31428/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31428\"><b>Sonic Colors</b></a>: <a href=\"/planet-wisp/3035-3510/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3510\">Planet Wisp</a></li><li><b>Boss</b>: Egg Dragoon / Eggmanland (<a href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\">Sonic Unleashed</a>)</li><li><b>Rival</b>: <a href=\"/silver-the-hedgehog/3005-1969/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1969\">Silver the Hedgehog</a> / Crisis City (<a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20584\">Sonic The Hedgehog (2006)</a>)</li></ul><h3>Bonus Content</h3><ul><li><b>Casino Night Zone Pinball Table</b> (Pre-Order DLC)</li><li><a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\"><b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b></a>(Full 1991 Game)</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Sonic Generations 3DS</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1869949-gi3tm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1869949\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1869949-gi3tm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1869949\"><img alt=\"FACT: Orcas hate hedgehogs\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1869949-gi3tm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/1869949-gi3tm.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>FACT: Orcas hate hedgehogs</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> version of Sonic Generations has, for the most part, separate levels from the PS3/360/PC editions.

It brings a distinct new setting to the Sonic series, going after the fantastical rather than realism, and takes inspiration from games like <a href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3025-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1347\">Mario Galaxy</a> to become an evolution of the <a href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">3D Sonic games</a>, as opposed to the throwback to the 2D classics like <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-1/3030-28078/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28078\">Sonic 4</a>.</p><p>There are two Sonic Colors games: a full 3D one for <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>, and a 2D one for <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>, and both were released on November 16, 2010. Sega has stated that if Sonic Colors for Wii sells well enough, they might port the game to the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>. However, a version for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 has yet to be announced, even over a year after Sonic Colors for Wii was released.</p><h2>Sonic Colors for Wii</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403723\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.599609375\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403723\"><img alt=\"Sonic explores Tropical Resort.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Sonic explores Tropical Resort.</figcaption></figure><p>The Wii game is a spiritual sequel to the ''daytime'' Sonic stages of <a href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\">Sonic Unleashed</a>. The stages are in full 3D in which Sonic can run and jump in any direction, periodically changing to a fixed 2D perspective for gameplay along a 2D plane, reminiscent of the original <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis/Megadrive</a> Sonic titles. The 2D part of the stages take up roughly half of the levels, with plenty of vertical level design for platforming. The 3D segments, however, are narrow, and encourage high speed acrobatics.</p><p>But unlike Sonic Unleashed's gameplay, Sonic Colors allows the speedy rodent to collect Wisps, colorful floating aliens that give him special abilities upon flicking the Wii remote. (Unless the player opts out of motion controls and uses a Wii Classic Controller, which the game supports.) These power-ups include abilities such turning into a drill that lets Sonic dig through rock or water, or increasing his speed while he bounces from the walls like a laser. Only one Wisp can be used at a time, and the power-ups have a gauge that displays how long they will last.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403725\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.599609375\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403725\"><img alt=\"Sonic rides the rail in Sweet Mountain Zone.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sonic rides the rail in Sweet Mountain Zone.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic rides the rail in Sweet Mountain Zone.</figcaption></figure><p>The levels are sizable and feature a very large amount of hidden paths and items, mostly accessible only with a specific power-up.

However, the DS levels make a cameo appearance in the backgrounds of the Wii game, while the same goes for the Wii version of the DS levels, giving the impression that each version shows a different view of the same world.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1384178\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2165450121655\" data-width=\"411\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 411px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1384178\"><img alt=\"Poster for Eggman's amusement park.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg 411w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Poster for Eggman's amusement park.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Poster for Eggman's amusement park.</figcaption></figure><p>Interested in the native Wisps, <a href=\"/dr-robotnik/3005-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-293\">Dr. Egggman (aka Robotnik)</a> has pulled their home planets together using a large tractor beam, and converted each planet into a large amusement park.

Described as a game primarily aimed for kids, the team decided to base each stage on a popular theme park attraction, and then blow it up to fit an entire planet.</p><p>This time they tried to let Sonic do something that made sense to his character, unlike their previous attempts at making him a were-hog or letting him handle a sword. When asked about Sonic, people always come up with speed, but the developers could not find any way to make Sonic's speed a main part of the gameplay, so they came up with a transformation system that gave him moves that fit with the nature of speed, like allowing him to pass through walls of rock or run over water. They made sure for those power-ups to remain a temporary transformation so that they do not dominate the gameplay, and keep Sonic always in motion with his traditional abilities.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1421710\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1421710\"><img alt=\"Drilling on a 2D segment.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg 600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Drilling on a 2D segment.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg 600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Drilling on a 2D segment.</figcaption></figure><p>While <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-1/3030-28078/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28078\">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a> is meant for the Sonic crowd that prefers the older games, this game is made for the audience that prefers the 3D games.

However, fans say that it is unavoidable, with classic Sonic fans complaining that speed is entirely the wrong way to go with the series, claiming that platforming was the basis for the character. However, bad press from the Sonic 4 leaks, and positive impressions from the E3 demos of this game brought more hype for Sonic Colors.</p>",

The people of this time have given up many of their freedoms to attain a state of peace and comfort. More specifically, since the flow of information is mainly technological, it is easily monitored by the totalitarian government. That's where <a href=\"/faith/3005-1422/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1422\">Faith</a>, the main character, and the other Runners come in.</p><p>A certain group of people didn't like the way things were changing in the city and were pushed to the fringe of society. Instead of communicating by more modern means, they hire Runners to get information from one place to another without \"Big Brother\" seeing what's being passed along. Runners are usually left alone, but at the beginning of the story, the government begins to criminalize the Runners and hunt them down.</p><p>The game starts off with Faith having to deliver a package to a fellow runner, <a href=\"/celeste/3005-8397/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8397\">Celeste</a>. She is guided through this level, as she is in most others, by a man named <a href=\"/mercury/3005-8188/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8188\">Merc</a>. He keeps in touch with her from a distant hideout (aptly named Merc's Lair), gives her assignments and often relays information to Faith. The first level mainly serves as the tutorial and has Faith being hunted down by the police. She escapes and returns to Merc's lair. She listens to the police radios and hears that shots have been fired in the building where her sister <a href=\"/kate-connors/3005-12825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12825\">Kate</a>, a police officer, currently is. Faith finds Kate in the office of a politician named Pope. When Faith arrives, she discovers that Pope has been murdered and that Kate has been framed. While looking for clues, Faith discovers that Pope was clutching a piece of paper with the words \"Icarus to the highest\" written on it. The cops arrive and Kate surrenders herself Faith can escape. Faith escapes by sliding down the side of a building while dodging helicopter gun fire, jumps onto train tracks, crashes through a glass ceiling and then meets with another runner.</p><p>Faith makes it back to Merc's lair alarmed and wondering why the cops are on high alert. Despite Faith not wanting to meet him, she comes into contact with <a href=\"/jacknife/3005-12826/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12826\">Jacknife</a>, a former runner now turned informant for Merc, who tells Faith that he has intel that might link Pope's murder to his security guard, an ex-wrestler named <a href=\"/ropeburn/3005-13214/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13214\">Ropeburn</a>. Before paying a visit to Ropeburn, Faith meets <a href=\"/miller/3005-13887/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13887\">Lt. Miller</a> in a parking lot to try and convince him to help Kate. Lt. Miller, also Kate's superior, knows that she is innocent but because of pressure coming from his superiors, he is powerless to do anything. Faith knows that Kate doesn't stand a chance in jail and questions Miller about Icarus who doesn't give her an answer. After this, Faith runs off.</p><p>Faith infiltrates Ropeburn's office and overhears him on the phone, realizing that he's the one who framed her sister and that he's setting up a meeting downtown. Faith once again meets Miller to tell him this. Miller pulls a gun on her, telling her that he's being pressured by private firms who want to install more security on the city and that the only way he can get them of his back is to hand her over. Faith escapes and goes to the meeting. She gets the upper hand and interrogates Ropeburn. As he's hanging off the ledge of the skyscraper, he's shot by a masked sniper before he can tell Faith any pertinent information. She later intercepts Jacknife, convinced that he was the one who tipped off the cops that she was coming. He rejects the accusation, saying that if he had wanted her dead he would have done it himself.</p><p>With Ropeburn dead, Faith is out of leads. She decides to investigate Pirandello/Kruger, a security firm that provides the city with its security and is also helping the police fight the runners. While investigating in their offices near the docks, Faith discovers that they are the ones behind Project Icarus, which is meant to train the police forces in parkour to fight the runners. She also discovers that Ropeburn's killer is hiding in the docks, and after fighting him, it's revealed that it is Celeste, who has been a part of Icarus. She chose Icarus to keep herself safe and strongly advises Faith to do the same. She also reveals that she killed Pope because he was beginning to question the security firms.</p><p>Faith escapes and discovers that Kate has been tried and found guilty for the murder. She's being moved to prison by convoy which Faith promptly intercepts. She saves Kate and leads the police away to allow time for Kate to get away. After losing the cops, Faith makes her way to Merc's lair. The lair has been raided by the police, taking Kate and killing Merc. With his last breath, Merc tells Faith that Kate has been taken to the Shard, the city's highest tower. The Mayor's office as well as most of the city's security is headquartered within the building. Faith manages to destroy the servers housing security information thanks to the help of Miller. She then makes it to the roof where she finds Jacknife holding Kate at gunpoint. Jacknife reveals that he's been with Icarus all along and was being used as bait to lure out the runners. As he is about to escape with Kate on a helicopter, Faith jumps onto the helicopter, kicks Jacknife off the helicopter and to his doom. Faith and Kate both escape safely and stand atop the building, overlooking the city.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Despite taking place in the first-person, Mirror's Edge takes the emphasis off gun wielding and focuses more on movement and momentum. As Faith runs she continually picks up speed. This speed allows her to pull of some of the more difficult acrobatic maneuvers, as well as perform the simpler ones without losing much momentum. Finding ways to retain that momentum is one the main challenges of the game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/207551-122.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207551\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/207551-122.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207551\"><img alt=\"Everything is performed from a first-person perspective.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/207551-122.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/207551-122.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3699/207551-122.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/207551-122.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Everything is performed from a first-person perspective.</figcaption></figure><p>On the consoles, the game is controlled by a combination of three buttons and the left stick, making the controls rather simple, although there are layers of complexity. Jumping and climbing over objects is done with the left bumper (L1 on PS3), while ducking and sliding under objects is done with the left trigger. The right bumper (R1 on PS3) allows you to perform a 180 degree spin, for quick turnaround. Those three buttons in combination with the left thumbstick can control most of the gameplay, with other buttons related to combat and Reaction Time (bullet-time).</p><p>The game's producer, Nick Channon, said in an interview with Gametrailers.com that each level of the game will present the player with a few ways to get through any given area and it's up to the player to find his/her own fastest way over/under/around each obstacle laid before him.</p><p>To aid in this decision making process, the game uses a color coding system called \"Runner Vision.\" Objects in the environment necessary to complete certain areas or perform certain movements are painted red, though this can be turned off on higher difficulty settings.</p><p>Faith is not armed by default. She can remove guns from enemies by force, but is unable to run while wielding them.</p><p>The melee combat system in the game is based on momentum as well. The more speed you have going at an enemy, the more effectively you'll be able to disarm and remove the enemy from your list of troubles.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Despite the fact that Mirror's Edge is primarily a \"free running\" game, there are still a variety of weapons the player can use to dispose of opponents, if he/she chooses to do so. There is one specific achievement in the game that encourages players to never fire a single shot during an entire playthrough of the game.</p><h3>Machine Guns</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/m249-saw/3055-623/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-623\">M249</a></li></ul><h3>Rifles</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/fn-scar/3055-790/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-790\">FN SCAR</a></li><li><a href=\"/hk-g36/3055-1879/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1879\">H&amp;K G36C</a></li></ul><h3>Sniper Rifles</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/barrett-m95/3055-1336/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1336\">Barrett M95</a></li></ul><h3>Shotguns</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/benelli-m3-super-90/3055-2755/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2755\">Benelli M3 Super 90</a></li><li><a href=\"/neostead-2000/3055-1356/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1356\">Neostead 2000</a></li></ul><h3>Submachine Guns</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/ruger-mp9/3055-2752/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2752\">B&amp;T MP9</a></li><li><a href=\"/mp5/3055-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-289\">H&amp;K MP5</a></li></ul><h3>Pistols</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/m1911/3055-61/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-61\">Colt M1911</a></li><li><a href=\"/m9-pistol/3055-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-940\">Beretta 92</a></li><li><a href=\"/glock-18/3055-1050/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1050\">Glock 18</a></li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/taser/3055-748/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-748\">Taser</a></li></ul><h2>Chapters</h2><p>Mirror's Edge story is divided into 9 Chapters plus a Prologue.</p><ul><li><strong>Prologue - </strong>The Edge</li><li><strong>Chapter 1 - </strong>Flight</li><li><strong>Chapter 2 - </strong>Jackknife</li><li><strong>Chapter 3 - </strong>Heat</li><li><strong>Chapter 4 - </strong>Ropeburn</li><li><strong>Chapter 5 - </strong>New Eden</li><li><strong>Chapter 6 - </strong>Pirandello Kruger</li><li><strong>Chapter 7 - </strong>The Boat</li><li><strong>Chapter 8 - </strong>Kate</li><li><strong>Chapter 9 - </strong>The Shard</li></ul><h2>Controls</h2><p>The normal first-person controls are mostly intact, but there is one major difference. The left bumper and left trigger (or L1 and L2 on the PS3) are designated as up and down, respectively. These buttons control all of the player's acrobatics. This control structure is designed to give the player ease of control while still leaving skill in the mix, mostly in terms of timed button presses. For example: when taking a leap over a gap to a lower platform you have to press down right when you hit the ground to do a roll to maintain momentum and save your knees.</p><p>Mirror's Edge also takes advantage of the PS3 Sixaxis controls, with various motions corresponding with actions. Rolling the controller can be used to roll after a long fall, and twisting the controller can take an enemy weapon.</p><p>When faced with a waist-high obstruction you can press up to vault over it or, in the case of there being a hole underneath, down to slide under.</p><h3>Default Controls</h3><ul><li><b>L1 / LB</b> / <b>Space Bar</b>: Jump / Grab onto poles / Climb / Wallrun</li><li><b>L2 / LT / Shift Key</b>: Soft landing / Slide</li><li><b>R2 / RT / Left Click</b>: Fight / Shoot / Smash doors open</li><li><b>Circle / B / Left Alt:</b> Aim toward objective / Hint</li><li><b>Square / X</b> / <b>R key</b>: Slow-Motion (Runner Vision)</li><li><b>Triangle / Y</b> / <b>Right Click</b>: Disarm (only when enemy is facing away from Faith or their weapon turns red)</li><li><b>X / A / E key</b>: Action button (pressing buttons, etc.)</li><li><b>Left Analog Stick / W A S D</b>: Walk / Run</li><li><b>Right Analog Stick</b> / <b>Mouse</b>: Camera</li></ul><h2>Game Modes</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-719068\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-719068\"><img alt=\"Time Trial Mode.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Time Trial Mode.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2488/719068-me8.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Time Trial Mode.</figcaption></figure><p>While Mirror's Edge's main focus is on the single-player campaign, there is \"a semi-multiplayer\" component. Time Trial levels are unlocked through progress in the story mode and the idea behind them is to complete a section of a level (not necessarily taking the same route as the level it was lifted from) going down a prescribed route in the fastest time possible. If connected to PSN or Xbox Live, the completion time is uploaded and can be used by other players to race against. In turn, their <a href=\"/ghost-racer/3015-3097/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3097\">ghost times</a> can be downloaded for your use.</p><p>The player sees a series of <a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/2488/719072-me3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">red checkpoint markers</a> that tell them where they're supposed to go, and a red figure represents the ghost data that gives you an indication of how well you're doing in any given Time Trial level. Loading up ghost racers can also give you a chance to see how others managed to get their times and how they handled certain sections of a level, a very useful feature for those trying to squeeze out the best time. Each Time Trial stage has a qualifying time, which if achieved, grants the player one star. If even faster times are achieved then two or even three stars are awarded for the level.</p><p>There is also a Speed Run mode, in which one is tasked with completing a whole chapter of the campaign under a stringent time limit. It usually requires a flawless run with no falls to finish them under par time.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p>Mirror's Edge downloadable content is available for purchase for all three versions of the game. The new content was originally scheduled for release on January 29th, 2009, but later delayed until February. Players are challenged to achieve the fastest times possible on nine races, across seven all new Time Trial maps with an all new, abstract design. There are no guns, police, or city environment. The pack is available for US $9.99 or 800 Microsoft points, and all PlayStation 3 owners are able to download an additional, exclusive map for free.</p><h2>Limited Edition</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1448395\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 485px\" data-ratio=\"0.57525773195876\" data-width=\"485\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1448395\"><img alt=\"Limited Edition Bag.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg 485w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Limited Edition Bag.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg 485w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/63119/1448395-fgirndvsnr1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Limited Edition Bag.</figcaption></figure><p>EA teamed up with Timbuk2 to create the \"Limited Edition Mirror's Edge Runner's Bag Bundle,\" which included a copy of the game with a Timbuk2 brand messenger bag.

We would have liked the game to sell better, even though the game has sold better than most people think</em>.\"</p></blockquote><p>In a February 2011 interview with Vicachu, Soderlund revealed that development work on Mirror's Edge 2 had stalled in favor of other projects, again citing the lack of Mirror's Edge sales as a disincentive for continuing work on the title.</p><p>On November 22 2012, <a href=\"/ben-cousins/3040-93517/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93517\">Ben Cousins</a>, the former executive producer of the Battlefield series, mentioned on twitter in regards to DICE working only in the Battlefield games that: \"It is general knowledge in the Stockholm dev scene that Mirror's Edge 2 is in production as DICE.\"</p><p>In May 2013, listings for the game briefly appeared on a few European Amazon websites, which were quickly removed. On May 30th, 2013, it was noticed that a help page for Mirror's Edge 2 existed on the EA website itself, but was promptly deleted later that same day.</p><h3>Announcement</h3><p>The game was officially announced on June 10th, 2013 at EA's <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/e3-2013/3015-7534/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7534\">E3</a> Press Conference. Some gameplay was revealed of Faith fighting masked agents, intercut with her receiving a tattoo on her arm (a tattoo she already has in the original game, suggesting the game is a prequel). The game was announced for PC, Xbox One, and PS4, with no release date given, only that it will come \"when it is ready.\"</p><p>On June 12, 2013, Patrick Söderlund explained in an interview that the game will be different compared to the first game. The original game received criticism on how it handled combat situations. Söderlund addressed this by saying: <em>\"The first game was a lot about running away from things and, even though you want to have sections with that, you also want Faith... she's a powerful character and you want her to take control. You'll see a little bit more of that in this game.''</em> At the same time, he made sure to explain that the game will not become a shooter saying: <em>\"Again, we're not going to turn this into a shooter. On the contrary, in fact. But we are going to evolve Faith and the story. Once we show more of this people will be genuinely excited. I am personally extremely excited about it.\"</em></p>",

It is played in the style of a 3rd person shooter. Each Kong uses his or her specific gun, that is also seen in the story mode, to dole out damage.

They must work to accomplish the objective at hand, which is determined by the game mode they have chosen.</p><h3>Arenas</h3><p>Arenas are Monkey Smash Arena's one through three.

When a player has the coin, they must travel over pads in order to earn the most points they can before time runs out.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The level Fungi Forest was initially created for <a href=\"../../banjo-kazooie/61-10920/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banjo-Kazooie </a>but since the game already had plenty of levels the producers decided to put it on Donkey Kong 64.</li><li>According to the Guinness World Records Games 2008 book this game holds the record for the largest amount of collectibles a game has ever had.</li></ul><h2>Reception</h2><p>Donkey Kong was well received among reviewers, but it fell short when compared to other Rare platformers like the <a href=\"../../banjo-kazooie/62-46/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banjo-Kazooie </a>franchise. The main complaint was that the game presented too many things to collect and that it was simply too long.</p><p>However, many praised the amazing graphics which were generated with the help of the expansion pack. The game was also praised for it's large amount of content.</p><h2>DK Rap</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1072367\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1072367\"><img alt=\"Screen capture from the DK rap\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Screen capture from the DK rap\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33306/1072367-gfs_41619_1_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Screen capture from the DK rap</figcaption></figure><p>The DK Rap was a rather long and catchy tune played at the beginning of the game before the menu screen.

The player can also switch to a number of other characters, each of which play differently.

His great age makes him the closest to a complete vampire in all facets, but he serves his darker lord all the same. Gilles de Rais knows that Dracula was born again as a human child. In order to locate his master and control the power, he commences a mass kidnapping of all the children from nearby hamlets, using both his devils and the help of Actrise to help his cause. He gathers the children in the castle, and locates the resurrected power of Dracula in a small boy called Malus. However, before the complete transformation and rebirth can be completed, he hears that two vampire hunters have infiltrated his castle.

The government is very strict and several gangs, including the GGs, have decided to <a href=\"/resistance/3015-2542/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2542\">rebel</a> against the oppressive government and fight back. Game-play is similar to the original <a href=\"/jet-grind-radio/3030-20096/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20096\">Jet Grind Radio</a>.

Most missions involve covering a rival gang's graffiti and are completed by tagging all points within a level. The act of tagging was altered from the original game; instead of manually painting graffiti, the player simply has to hold the right trigger to spray.</p><p>Combat mostly involves instances with the Rokkaku Police. The player is required to knock soldiers over and then spray them with graffiti until their health lowers. <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">Bosses</a> require the same spray can strategy but have significantly more hit points than average enemies.</p><p>The game features the same kind of <a href=\"/cel-shaded-animation/3015-173/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-173\">cel-shading</a> that it was well known for in the original game and is considered by many to be one of the most impressive looking games on the Xbox to date. The game also has an amazing and quite lengthy soundtrack. The soundtrack adds up to about 30 songs ranging from various <a href=\"/cel-shaded-animation/3015-173/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-173\">J-Pop</a> artists and video game music artist such as BIS and Scapegoat Wax. JSRF also features a multiplayer mode which is only available to play locally. There are races, <a href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-25\">capture the flag</a>, and various other match types. All of these types can be played with up to 3 other players. As well as a multiplayer mode JSRF also features a robust graffiti editor allowing the player to create their own graffiti tags for use in the game. New graffiti designs can also be unlocked by finding collectibles called \"Graffiti Souls\" throughout each level of the single-player game.</p><p>Note that the other names are from Jet Grind Radio. These characters were also in the original game but had a name change in Jet Set Radio Future.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/484086-jet_set_radio_future_soundtrack_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-484086\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/484086-jet_set_radio_future_soundtrack_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-484086\"><img alt=\"Cover of the Japanese Soundtrack.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/484086-jet_set_radio_future_soundtrack_cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/484086-jet_set_radio_future_soundtrack_cover.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cover of the Japanese Soundtrack.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/484086-jet_set_radio_future_soundtrack_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5785/484086-jet_set_radio_future_soundtrack_cover.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cover of the Japanese Soundtrack.</figcaption></figure><p>Soundtrack for Jet Set Radio Future:</p><ol><li>Humming the Bassline (D.S.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Astal was meant to be a showcase of the Sega Saturn's 2D capabilities. It features large, colorful sprites, and detailed background artwork that appears to have been hand-painted. Unfortunately, Astal's release came at a time where the gaming market was moving towards 3D graphics with Sony's Playstation console, resulting in poor sales. Due to the poor sales of the game, it is considered to be somewhat of a rarity in certain circles.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840219-image6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-840219\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840219-image6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-840219\"><img alt=\"Astal Punch!\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840219-image6.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840219-image6.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Astal Punch!</figcaption></figure><p>The protagonist is the namesake character Astal. Astal's primary method of attack is to grab enemies directly in front of him and throw them over his shoulder. By jumping in to the air and attacking, Astal slams his fists downward. Pressing down and attacking will cause Astal to violently punch the earth, stunning all enemies on screen. As a final method of attack, holding up on the D-pad will cause Astal to inhale large quantities of air, which can be released by pressing the attack button. A fully charged gust of wind can kill lesser enemies and stuns larger ones. After rescuing a small bird in the first level, Astal can command it to do various tasks for him, such as fetching extra health when needed, or attacking enemies. By plugging in a second controller, Player 2 is given control of the bird.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840227-image15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-840227\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840227-image15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-840227\"><img alt=\"\"Help me, Astal!\"\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840227-image15.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/840227-image15.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>\"Help me, Astal!\"</figcaption></figure><p>Somewhere in the universe, the Goddess Antowas created a world using only a single jewel. This world was known as Quartilia, and to inhabit this lonely world, Antowas created two humans: from a red jewel, a boy, named Astal; and from a green jewel, a girl, Leda. Leda was blessed by Antowas with the gift to create life, and it was Astal's job to protect Leda from any dangers. Despite Astal's sometimes over-protective nature, Leda fell in love with Astal. Content with her creation, the Goddess Antowas slept. Seeing his opportunity, the evil demon Gerado attempted to conquer Quartilia as his own; but Astal and Leda resisted his efforts. To help with this task, Gerado created his own human: Geist. Geist kidnapped Leda, and imprisoned her at the bottom of the Ocean. Astal fought bravely to rescue Leda, but in doing so, he shattered the bottom of the ocean, destroying it. The battle between Astal and Geist eventually woke Antowas, who fought Gerado and won. Angry with Astal for ruining the ocean, Antowas banished him - but Leda took pity on Astal, and gave him her necklace. With the matter of Astal and Gerado settled, Antowas went back to sleep once again. Unable to stand being separated from Leda, Astal shatters his bonds and frees himself from the realm Antowas had banished him to, only to return to find Leda has once again been kidnapped. Astal's quest to rescue Leda begins once again...</p><h2>Levels</h2><ul><li><strong>Stage 1</strong>: The Journey Begins</li><li><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Into the Darkness</li><li><strong>BOSS</strong>: The Evil Eye</li><li><strong>Stage 3</strong>: The Deep Forest</li><li><strong>Stage 4</strong>: The River of Dreams</li><li><strong>BOSS</strong>: The Forest Fiend</li><li><strong>Stage 5</strong>: Volcanic Valley</li><li><strong>BOSS</strong>: The Guardian of Fire</li><li><strong>Stage 6</strong>: Sea of Clouds</li><li><strong>Stage 7</strong>: Glacial Rift</li><li><strong>Stage 8</strong>: The Crystal Palace</li><li><strong>BOSS</strong>: Frostbite</li><li><strong>Stage 9</strong>: Plains of Destiny</li><li><strong>BOSS</strong>: Destiny Unfolds</li><li><strong>BOSS</strong>: The Fight for the Future</li></ul><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Astal made frequent cameo appearances in Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic series, as cover artist Patrick Spaziante was a big fan of the game and the character.</li><li>The North American Box for Astal contains an oddity among Sega Saturn titles: the spine for the game case is blank.

The player's bus cannot slow down or stop, and will in fact speed up as time goes on, so they must navigate around levels with this detriment in mind. Goals range from reaching the end of the level, collecting piles of money after a heist, or safely carrying passengers to a target area. The game's distinctive low-poly look is a deliberate homage to the 32-bit gaming era. </p><p>OmniBus was released on Steam in 2016 for PC, Mac and Linux. </p>",

The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the \"collecting videotape\" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).</p><p>The game was ported to the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on October 31, 2000 (by <a href=\"/lti-gray-matter/3010-917/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-917\">LTI Gray Matter</a>), the <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast</a> on November 6, 2000 (by <a href=\"/treyarch/3010-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1488\">Treyarch</a>), the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> on August 21, 2001 (by <a href=\"/edge-of-reality-ltd/3010-3764/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3764\">Edge of Reality</a>), and all <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from <a href=\"/mat-hoffmans-pro-bmx/3030-2341/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2341\">Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX</a> and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the <a href=\"/entertainment-software-ratings-board/3010-6476/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6476\">ESRB</a> rating from \"T\" to \"E\").

Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the \"Manuals\" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.</p><p>A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1308582-cash.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308582\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86440677966102\" data-width=\"118\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 118px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1308582-cash.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308582\"><img alt=\"Cash Collectables\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" data-width=\"118\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1308582-cash.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1308582-cash.png 118w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cash Collectables\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1308582-cash.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1308582-cash.png 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px\" data-width=\"118\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cash Collectables</figcaption></figure><p>Cash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character.</p><h2>Levels</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1354552-hangar.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1354552\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.45132743362832\" data-width=\"226\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 226px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1354552-hangar.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1354552\"><img alt=\"Hangar\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-width=\"226\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1354552-hangar.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1354552-hangar.png 226w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hangar\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1354552-hangar.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/1354552-hangar.png 226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\" data-width=\"226\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hangar</figcaption></figure><p><b>Location:</b> Mullet Falls, Montana</p><p>Hangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar.

The fourth installment of the long-running <a href=\"/tony-hawk/3025-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-10\">Tony Hawk</a> franchise and the sequel to <a href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5688\">Pro Skater 3</a>, Pro Skater 4 was the last main game in the franchise to bear the Pro Skater name until <a href=\"/tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-5/3030-48191/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48191\">Pro Skater 5</a>, adding new levels, skaters, and tricks (such as Flatland Tricks, Grind and Lip Trick Extensions, <a href=\"/skitching/3015-4902/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4902\">skitching</a> vehicles, and Spine Transfers, which allow players to switch between connecting quarter-pipes or self-right themselves to exit quarter-pipes without bailing), as well as a new Career Mode system (where players skate around levels similar to Free Skate mode, and are given objectives and mini-games by talking with <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs</a>). A limited version of <a href=\"/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/3030-990/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-990\">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</a>'s currency system returns (by completing objectives and special mini-games, as well as collecting cash pickups, players can buy clothes for the Create-A-Skater mode, decks, movies, cheats, secret skaters, and hidden levels).</p><p>The game was ported to the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> alongside the original release, and came to <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in 2003. The PlayStation version runs on a slightly-modified Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 engine, changing the level structure of most levels while replacing the Zoo, Carnival, and Chicago levels with two new levels: Sewers and Little Big World (the counter-tops of a giant kitchen).</p><p>Handheld versions were released on both the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> and the <a href=\"/zodiac/3045-64/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-64\">Zodiac</a> in 2004. Both games feature a 2D <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric viewpoint</a>, and carry over several elements from the console versions.</p><p>As in THPS 2 and 3, hidden <a href=\"/crossover/3015-732/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-732\">crossover characters</a> are included: <a href=\"/jango-fett/3005-2596/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2596\">Jango Fett</a>, a bounty hunter from the <a href=\"/star-wars/3025-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a> franchise, and <a href=\"/eddie-the-head/3005-22645/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22645\">Eddie the Head</a>, mascot of the band <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Maiden</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The core skating mechanics are mostly unchanged from previous games, but one major new feature is the spine transfer, which allows players to either switch to a ramp on the other side of a vert, level off when launched away from a ramp, or land correctly into a ramp if entering from a flat area.</p><p>Also new to the game are pogo tricks, performed during manuals by tapping one of the face buttons. Depending on the trick, the skater will perform a handstand on the board or stand on the side of the board. Extensive use of the pogo system is effective during combos.</p><p>The way goals are received is much different from previous games, adopting a sandbox-style system where goals are given by characters around the level. Completing a goal is rewarded with stat points that can assigned, and sometimes special trick slots. The game also reintroduces the concept of money, which was present in THPS 2 but not 3. Small amounts of money can be found throughout the level, usually by going up a ramp or grinding rails.</p><p>Each skater, including the custom skater, has a unique \"end\" goal, which is often very elaborate.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Wheel of Time is a fantasy FPS game released on the PC by Legend Entertainment in 1999. Prior to this game's release, Legend Entertainment were best known for their text and graphic adventure games based on sci-fi and fantasy literary works, all of which adopted a first-person perspective. The Wheel of Time is also loosely based on a literary work - the verbose novel series of the same name from Robert Jordan - and contains its own self-contained story within that setting.</p><p>Legend were prompted to start creating action games after their acquisition by <a href=\"/gt-interactive-software-corp/3010-479/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-479\">GT Interactive</a>, the publisher behind many of <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id Software</a>'s classic FPS games. The Wheel of Time would be the last game they developed based on a literary property.</p><p>The game was released in both the US and Europe. It is presently unavailable on Steam or GOG.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/483781-shot0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483781\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/483781-shot0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483781\"><img alt=\"Shadar Logoth\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/483781-shot0001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/483781-shot0001.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/483781-shot0001.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/483781-shot0001.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>Shadar Logoth</figcaption></figure><p>The story focuses on Eleyna, an Aes Sedai (<i>i.e.</i> sorceress), who is tasked with recovering stolen seals, which if destroyed could unleash the Dark One.</p><p>Compared to most FPS games at the time, The Wheel of Time is very story-heavy with over 60 minutes of cutscenes. The plot, built especially for the game, allowed the player to encounter many of the locations and enemies featured in the books such as the corrupted and abandoned city of Shadar Logoth and a Whitecloak fortress. The scenery stood out from other typically sci-fi themed shooters and is an aspect of the game that was widely praised at the time of its release.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The Wheel of Time uses the Unreal Engine and the single player gameplay is in many ways typical of first person shooters of the time. In place of guns, players use over thirty Ter'Angreal (powerful artifacts from the Wheel of Time universe). Some are directly comparable to normal FPS guns, such as the fireball being nearly identical in function to an Unreal or Quake style rocket launcher. Others are more unusual for a FPS, as they produce defense-oriented effects, such as shields for each element and a mirror that can be used to redirect magical seeking missiles back at the caster.</p><p> </p><h2>Multiplayer </h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/483831-shot0016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483831\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/483831-shot0016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483831\"><img alt=\"Magical combat\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/483831-shot0016.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/483831-shot0016.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15568/483831-shot0016.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/483831-shot0016.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>Magical combat</figcaption></figure><p>The multiplayer featured two modes, which was low compared to the giants of the genre. One was deathmatch, which (because of the weapon set up) played differently enough from Unreal or Quake DM to make it worth playing. The other was Citadel, which is similar to CTF, but again offered an interesting twist with the ability to set up various defenses around your base (such as NPC guards, mines and other magical traps). Loyal fans played the multiplayer modes for years after release.</p>",

In the game, players play as a bear named <a href=\"/banjo/3005-63/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-63\">Banjo</a> who wears a backpack containing his bird-friend - <a href=\"/kazooie/3005-213/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-213\">Kazooie</a>. The game features large worlds full of collectibles, secrets, and enemies.</p><p>Throughout his journey, Banjo and Kazooie must collect notes, new powers, and <a href=\"/jiggy/3055-2853/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2853\">jiggys</a> to advance to the next level. Also, the game features a very distinct soundtrack that features heavy use of a <a href=\"/banjo/3055-850/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-850\">banjo</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Banjo-Kazooie begins with a wicked witch named <a href=\"/gruntilda/3005-912/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-912\">Gruntilda</a> stirring a green liquid in her cauldron called <a href=\"/dingpot/3005-17999/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17999\">Dingpot</a>. She claims to be the most beautiful woman, until Dingpot explains how she is not, and that <a href=\"/tooty/3005-1639/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1639\">Tooty</a> (Banjo's sister) is the prettiest girl ever. Gruntilda, who is always speaking in rhymes, explains how she will capture Tooty.</p><p>She is successful and threatens to switch appearances with Tooty, when Banjo hears of what happened. From then on it is Banjo's duty to stop Gruntilda, with his bird-friend Kazooie, by going to different worlds, collecting tons of items, and eventually confronting Gruntilda herself.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-920391\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.564453125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-920391\"><img alt=\"Snow Areas.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/920391-freezeezy_peak_snowman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Snow Areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Banjo-Kazooie follows a structure similar to that of <a href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\">Super Mario 64</a>. Players are tasked with finding various collectible objects such <a href=\"/jiggy/3055-2853/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2853\">Jiggys</a> (Jigsaw Pieces), <a href=\"/musical-notes/3055-963/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-963\">Musical Notes</a>, and <a href=\"/mumbo-token/3055-4751/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4751\">Mumbo Tokens</a> and then using those objects to traverse through the hub-world. Jigsaw pieces open doors to new worlds by collecting enough to complete the corresponding jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>There are ten Jiggies in each world: nine must be found, and one is granted by finding all five <a href=\"/jinjos/3015-540/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-540\">Jinjos</a> on each world. Musical Notes open magic <a href=\"/note-door/3055-4759/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4759\">note doors</a> that allow <a href=\"/banjo/3005-63/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-63\">Banjo</a> and <a href=\"/kazooie/3005-213/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-213\">Kazooie</a> to progress further into <a href=\"/gruntildas-lair/3035-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-400\">Gruntilda's lair</a>. There are 100 notes in each world, and 900 total in the game. Mumbo Tokens grant the player magical transformations at <a href=\"/mumbo-jumbo/3005-1223/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1223\">Mumbo's</a> hut when the player collects a sufficient amount. These transformations include the following: termite, crocodile, walrus, pumpkin and bee.</p><p>On the way, players will meet many characters, but the one who will help players the most is Mumbo - A skull-man who is able to cast magic. He helps Banjo on his quest by opening secret doors and stopping trains. Banjo travels along with his bird companion, Kazooie; she allows him to fly, climb, and she can turn into an egg-firing machine gun.</p><p>Together they are bound to take down the evil Gruntilda - An evil witch who wants to control the world and commit evil deeds. She resides in her lair, with her trusty troll like companion.</p><p>If a player receives a game over, a cut scene is show of Gruntilda successfully switching appearances with Tooty and becoming a beautiful witch, then mocking Banjo as the screen fades out.</p><h2>Characters</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><h3><a href=\"/banjo/3005-63/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-63\">Banjo the Bear</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/599060-banjo_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-599060\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2488888888889\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 225px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/599060-banjo_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-599060\"><img alt=\"Banjo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/599060-banjo_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/599060-banjo_4.jpg 225w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Banjo\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/599060-banjo_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3498/599060-banjo_4.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Banjo</figcaption></figure><br />One of the two protagonists of the game, Banjo is a quirky Honey Bear trying to rescue his younger sister, Tooty.

The voices are not real speech, but rather a looping of voice-like sounds when text bubbles were displayed.</p><p>This artistic choice was likely made due to memory limitations on <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> cartridges; however, this added considerably to the atmosphere and uniqueness of the game. The gibberish like speech would go on to become a staple of the series to the point where when the series moved over to the Xbox 360 (a system more than capable of handling speech) with Banjo and Kazooie Nuts and Bolts the team opted to stick with gibberish.</p><p>In addition this manner of speech has influenced many a games. Rare themselves re-used the trope in <a href=\"/grabbed-by-the-ghoulies/3030-1484/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1484\">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</a>.</p><h2>Stop 'N' Swop</h2><p><a href=\"/stop-n-swop/3015-3333/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3333\">Stop 'N' Swop</a> is an incomplete feature in Banjo-Kazooie. During development of the game, the team at Rare learned that if the N64 cartridge was pulled out without shutting off the power, the game would retain memory for a few seconds. The team intended to incorporate this \"feature\" into the game proving a hook for the game's sequel. After collecting 100 Jiggies, Mumbo shows Banjo and Kazooie a movie showing the duo reaching inaccessible areas saying that this will be poossible in the sequel Banjo-Tooie. At first it was unknown how this games would could connect, but eventually hackers discovered menu titled \"Stop 'N' Swop\" in the game code that would of allowed Banjo to get these items. Shortly after the game was released, Nintendo released a newer model N64 that significantly shortened the length of time a cart-less N65 could hold data. Rare conceded and the Stop N Swap feature was canned, only to be resurrected nearly ten years later.</p><p>In January 2009, Banjo-Tooie was announced for the <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live Arcade</a> , together with the return of the Stop 'n' Swop link between the two original games to unlock hidden material in Banjo-Tooie.</p><p>On the XBLA version of the game, 6 special Stop 'N' Swop eggs can be found without the use of cheats. The egg locations are as follows:</p><ul><li>-Pink Egg- In Treasure Trove Cove. There will be an island called Sharkfood Island. Inside it is a mountain on top of which is the pink egg.</li><li>-Cyan Egg- Mad Monster Mansion. In the cellar one barrel will have the Cyan egg deep inside it.</li><li>-Green Egg- Mad Monster Mansion. In the bathroom the Green egg will be on top of Loggo.</li><li>-Blue Egg- Gobi's Valley. One of the magic carpets will take Banjo to the location of Gobi before he leaves the desert. In the building will be a sarcophagus containing the Blue Egg.</li><li>-Red Egg- Rusty Bucket Bay. In the captain's quarters through one of the portholes will have the red egg.</li><li>-Yellow Egg- Click Clock Wood. In the Winter season, in Nabnut the squirrel's house will hold the yellow egg.</li></ul><p>There is also an ice key that can be found In Freezeezy Peak in Wozza the Walrus' cave.</p><h2>Other Changes Prior To Release</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19967/766045-beta01_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-766045\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88257575757576\" data-width=\"264\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 264px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19967/766045-beta01_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-766045\"><img alt=\"The Old Logo.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19967/766045-beta01_logo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19967/766045-beta01_logo.jpg 264w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Old Logo.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19967/766045-beta01_logo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19967/766045-beta01_logo.jpg 264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Old Logo.</figcaption></figure><p>Between its release and being first announced at E3 in 1997, the game underwent a number of significant changes. At the time, the title \"Dream\", was simply derived from Rare's codename for the game \"Project: Dream\". Kazooie was originally named Kazoo, however her name had already been copyrighted, leading to the renaming of the character and the game's subsequent title. The first logo that was revealed also differs greatly from the current one.</p><p>Banjo-Kazooie was meant to have 16 levels, however some were cut in order to meet the game's release schedule. These included Mount Fire Eyes, which eventually ended up as the lava side of <a href=\"/hailfire-peaks/3035-410/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-410\">Hailfire Peaks</a> in Banjo-Tooie, and Fungus Forest, which became Fungi Forest in <a href=\"/donkey-kong-64/3030-15000/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15000\">Donkey Kong 64</a> and was the area depicted on the game's Box Art. Although rumors have circulated regarding a Hammerhead Beach level, this was only the beta name for the beach level which ended up being called Treasure Trove Cove. A mine and circus level were also originally planned for the game, but were scrapped and used in the game's sequel instead.</p><p>As well as the Stop 'n' Swop feature with Banjo-Tooie, there was also a rumored link up to Donkey Kong 64 that never came to fruition. Although the feature was never used in Banjo-Tooie, two hackers of the Rare Witch Project uncovered the codes to unlock the obtainable items by entering the codes in the Treasure Trove Cove sandcastle area after entering the word \"CHEAT\". They were posted shortly after Banjo-Tooie's release in 2001. Those codes are as follows:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">A DESERT DOOR OPENS WIDE ANCIENT SECRETS WAIT INSIDE (Gobi's Valley)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">OUT OF THE SEA IT RISES TO REVEAL MORE SECRET PRIZES (Treasure Trove Cove)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">NOW YOU CAN SEE A NICE ICE KEY WHICH YOU CAN HAVE FOR FREE (Freezeezy Peaks)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMIDST THE HAUNTED GLOOM A SECRET IN THE BATHROOM (Mad Monster Mansion)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">DONT YOU GO AND TELL HER ABOUT THE SECRET IN HER CELLAR (Mad Monster Mansion)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">THIS SECRET YOULL BE GRABBIN IN THE CAPTAINS CABIN (Rusty Bucket Bay)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rare-extreme.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6592\" rel=\"nofollow\">NOW BANJO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT ON NABNUTS TABLE (Click Clock Wood)</a></p><p>Several other small elements were excluded from the final game, including things on a level-by-level basis.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Pokémon Puzzle League is a <a href=\"/pokemon/3025-452/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\">Pokémon</a>-themed version of the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo</a> game Panel de Pon, also known as <a href=\"/tetris-attack/3030-13130/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13130\">Tetris Attack</a> in North America. The game was originally released for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> and is currently available as a downloadable <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> title on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Nintendo Wii</a>. The game can be played in standard 2D mode or a 3D mode in which the player can rotate the field. As in Tetris Attack, the goal of the game is to clear blocks from the field by lining up three or more blocks of the same color horizontally or vertically. The game includes several modes of play including a single-player vs. mode against the CPU, a two-player versus mode, and challenge modes including a time attack, puzzle mode, and line-clearing mode.</p><p>Pokémon Puzzle League is unique among Pokémon games in that it is one of the very few games to use characters originally created for the Pokémon anime series as opposed to the characters actually featured in the games. It also features art and brief animated cinematics from the anime, as well as voice acting from the anime series' English cast.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The game features fifteen characters that appear in the anime.

Players can return to the region of <a href=\"/johto/3035-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-463\">Johto</a> with updated graphics and sound, as well as wide variety of other new features. One of the most visible additions is the ability to summon out any Pokémon in the party to the field, following the player around outside of battle, much like <a href=\"/pikachu/3015-1269/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1269\">Pikachu</a> behaved in <a href=\"/pokemon-yellow-special-pikachu-edition/3030-18673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18673\">Pokémon Yellow</a>. All 493 Pokémon are able to follow the trainer around outside of its <a href=\"/poke-ball/3055-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-425\">Pokéball</a>. Team Rocket also return with new uniforms that better resemble the uniforms from FireRed and LeafGreen. There are also new mini-games added that replace Pokémon Contests, called the Pokéathlon.</p><p>New areas have introductory still images upon entrance, much like Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. A new female protagonist – different from the female protagonist introduced in <a href=\"/pokemon-crystal/3030-15861/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15861\">Pokémon Crystal</a> – is also available as a character choice in the very beginning of the game. The character opposite the chosen character's gender will play role as a support character.</p><h2>New Features and Changes</h2><h3>Fourth-gen Upgrades and Kanto Changes</h3><p>Many of the features from <a href=\"/pokemon-diamondpearl/3030-3240/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3240\">Pokémon Diamond/Pearl</a> and <a href=\"/pokemon-platinum/3030-21676/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21676\">Platinum</a> make their appearance in HeartGold and SoulSilver: a Global Trade Station has been built in Goldenrod city, while Fuschia's famous Safari Zone has been converted into a Pal Park. Platinum's Battle Frontier has been rebuilt brick-for-brick west of Olivine, ready to welcome any trainers who can best Johto's Elite Four. Also as in Platinum, each <a href=\"/gym-leader/3015-3385/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3385\">gym leader</a> may be challenged to a rematch after certain conditions are met, with each leader bringing a significantly stronger team for round two.</p><p><a href=\"/kanto/3035-206/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-206\">Kanto</a> has also undergone changes of its own. The Viridian Forest--chopped down in the original Gold and Silver--returns as a fully-featured area ready to meet all <a href=\"/caterpie/3015-1022/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1022\">Caterpie</a> and <a href=\"/weedle/3015-1040/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1040\">Weedle</a> needs. Cerulean Cave has likewise not collapsed in the remakes and powerful Pokémon (along with one old familiar face) are ready to face any trainer strong enough to collect all 16 gym badges. Kanto trainers have <a href=\"/hoenn/3035-350/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-350\">Hoenn</a> and <a href=\"/sinnoh/3035-465/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-465\">Sinnoh</a> Pokémon at their disposal, and certain radio stations now play the music needed to find those Pokémon in the Kanto/Johto region as well.</p><h3>Partner Pokémon</h3><p>Taking a cue from Pokémon Yellow, the Pokémon in the first party slot now follows the player around outside of battle. The Pokémon can be talked to in order to determine its condition, happiness, and even to take items it has found lying on the ground. This feature is also used by non-player characters seeking certain Pokémon, who will refuse to acknowledge that the player has brought them the Pokémon of their desire until it is out of its <a href=\"/\">Pokéball</a> and trotting along behind them.</p><h3>Pokéathlon</h3><p>Johto's Pokémon contests are a major departure from the dog show-style contests in Hoenn and Sinnoh. In the Pokéathlon, each trainer brings a team of three Pokémon to compete in a competitions of physical prowess. There are five sets of Pokéathlon competitions, each with a set of three minigames that emphasize a particular stat: the strength Pokéathlon, for instance, involves plenty of brick-smashing and sumo-style throwdowns, while the speed Pokéathlon involves Pokémon leaping hurdles and competing to see which team can complete the most laps around a track within a time limit. Trainers receive points for their team's performance in each game, and the trainer with the highest total at the end (including any <a href=\"/mario-party/3030-6424/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6424\">Mario Party</a>-style bonus points) is the winner.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60879/1308674-hgss5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308674\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74561403508772\" data-width=\"228\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 228px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60879/1308674-hgss5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1308674\"><img alt=\"Timing the jumps of three Pokémon at once is the major challenge in Hurdle Dash.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60879/1308674-hgss5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/60879/1308674-hgss5.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-width=\"228\"></a><figcaption>Timing the jumps of three Pokémon at once is the major challenge in Hurdle Dash.</figcaption></figure><p>Each Pokémon is rated for the five Pokéathlon stats, with modifications made for the Pokémon's personality and any Aprijuice it has consumed to (legally) increase its performance. The player controls his or her three-Pokémon team through the use of the touch screen, directing their movements and actions through tapping, flicks, and drawing motions of the stylus. In contrast to Beauty Contests (which offered mostly superficial rewards), points earned in the Pokéathlon can be put towards items such as evolutionary stones, <a href=\"/rare-candy/3055-1273/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1273\">Rare Candies</a>, and apricorns.</p><h3>Improved Touchscreen Interface</h3><p>Many of the menus in HeartGold and SoulSilver have been redesigned for improved touchscreen control. The basic menu options can be called at any time by hitting their icon on the touchscreen, and the player's set items (such as the Bicycle or Dowsing MCHN) can be used in a similar manner. The items screen has received a major redesign as well, trading the awkward Pokéball knob for a much cleaner and more intuitive interface. The PC box system is the most notable beneficiary of this upgrade, with the player now able to move Pokémon between boxes and his or her team through drag-and-drop stylus controls.</p><h2>PokéWalker</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335551\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"293\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 293px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335551\"><img alt=\"The Pokewalker with Pikachu inside.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" data-width=\"293\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1335551-pokewalker.jpg 293w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Pokewalker with Pikachu inside.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1335551-pokewalker.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1335551-pokewalker.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px\" data-width=\"293\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Pokewalker with Pikachu inside.</figcaption></figure><p>The Pokéwalker is the evolution of the old Pokémon Pikachu toy released in November 1998. It allows the user to carry one of their Pokémon from HeartGold and SoulSilver along with them. They cannot use this Pokémon in the game while it is in the device. The player can start using the walker when they have a Pokémon in the computer in the Pokémon Center. So as long as they have two Pokémon, they can use the Pokéwalker.</p><p>The player is able to carry three captured Pokémon in the Pokéwalker</p><h3>Steps and Watts</h3><p>The Pokéwalker has a built in pedometer that measures the user's steps, and like other pedometers, it can be tricked by shaking the device. The steps are used to unlock new <a href=\"/pokemon/3025-452/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\">Pokémon</a> to capture and items to find.

It takes 20 steps to earn a watt. The watts can be used for the minigames built into the Pokéwalker, and to unlock new routes to walk on.</p><p>The game will record the number of steps the user has taken, and any unused watts will go towards unlocking new routes when the Pokémon is returned or items are dropped off.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1357475\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.45806451612903\" data-width=\"620\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1357475\"><img alt=\"The Pokéwalker side and back view \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg 620w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Pokéwalker side and back view \" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg 620w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85465/1357475-img_pokewalker_07_01.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Pokéwalker side and back view </figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon will also gain one experience point for every step taken. However, the player may only level up once per trip. So they must return the Pokémon and resend it to level up again. There is a downside to this, if the Pokémon is scheduled to learn a move at the next level they hit, and they already have 4 moves, they will skip that move. No warning at all. (Example: Gastly learns Confuse Ray at <a href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\"> Level</a> 19, if I get to Level 19 on the Pokéwalker, <a href=\"/gastly/3015-1976/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1976\"> Gastly</a> misses the chance to learn the move. And now has to go to the move relearner to learn it.</p><p>The Pokéwalker will reset the number of steps it has at midnight. The number of watts will not reset.</p><h2>Minigames on the Pokewalker</h2><h3>Dowsing Machine</h3><p>The dowsing machine is a <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\"> minigame</a> on the Pokéwalker. It is a glorified version of the shell game. It costs three watts (approximately 60 steps) to use.</p><p>There are six tufts of <a href=\"/grass/3055-198/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-198\"> grass</a> in a row, and the player has two chances to guess where the item is. If they guess correctly they get the item. If they guess incorrectly, they have another guess. There is also a hint as to where it is.</p><p>Either one of two messages will pop up. “It’s near!” meaning it is right next to it. “It’s far away…” mean it’s not.</p><p>Anything from berries to TMs can be found here. TMs are usually rare and will only unlock with a large number of steps.</p><h3>Poké Radar</h3><p>The Poké Radar is a minigame that is divided into two parts.</p><h4>Part One</h4><p>Where the player has to “chase the Pokémon.” There are four tufts of grass, and an exclamation point will appear on one, they have to move to that patch of grass and press the action button before the Pokémon runs away. The “rarer” the Pokémon, the longer the chase will go, up to a maximum of four times. Once the chase ends, the player will advance to part two.</p><h4>Part  Two</h4><p>An extremely simplified version of a Pokémon battle. There are no <a href=\"/attributes/3015-1681/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\"> stats</a> taken into account, the player's Pokémon and the enemy Pokémon will have 4HP each. The player has three options: attack, evade, and catch.</p><ul><li><b>Attack</b> - The active Pokémon will attack, obviously. Each attack does one point of damage, unless it is a <a href=\"/critical-hit/3015-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-97\"> critical hit</a>, then it does two points. The attack will not hit if the enemy evades it.</li><li><b>Evade</b> - The active Pokémon attempts to <a href=\"/dodge/3015-2476/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\"> dodge</a> an incoming attack. If the opponent attacks while the player evades, they will dodge the attack, taking zero damage, and then counterattacks, dealing one damage back. If both Pokémon evade, a “stare down” will occur, and nothing will happen.</li><li><b>Catch </b>- The player attempts to <a href=\"/enemy-capture/3015-981/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-981\">capture</a> the Pokémon, like in the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a> game, the weaker the Pokémon, the easier it will be to catch. 1 HP Pokémon are pretty much guaranteed, while 4 HP Pokémon are near impossible, although it has happened before.</li></ul><h2>Version Differences</h2><h3>Legendary Pokemon</h3><p>It wouldn't be a Pokémon game without legendary Pokémon to capture, and HeartGold and SoulSilver do not disappoint. The Johto legendaries make their proud appearance, while many of the Kanto and Hoenn legendaries come along for the ride:</p><h4>Lugia and Ho-Oh</h4><p>As in the first game, <a href=\"/lugia/3015-1815/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1815\">Lugia</a> and <a href=\"/ho-oh/3015-1816/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1816\">Ho-Oh</a> are available for capture in both versions of the game. The first is encountered at level 40 and must be either captured or defeated in order to continue in the game, while the second becomes available at level 70 after the player makes significant progress through Kanto.</p><p> </p><h4>The Legendary Beasts</h4><p>Gold and Silver's legendary trio (<a href=\"/suicune/3015-4103/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4103\">Suicune</a>, <a href=\"/raikou/3015-4102/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4102\">Raikou</a>, and <a href=\"/entei/3015-4104/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4104\">Entei</a>) are first encountered in Ecruteak's Burned Tower, which they soon leave in order to roam the wider world. Raikou and Entei can both be found randomly across Johto, while the player must spot Suicune in several different locations before finally getting the chance to capture it in Kanto.</p><p> </p><h4>The Legendary Birds</h4><p>New to the remakes is the reappearance of the legendary Pokémon <a href=\"/articuno/3015-2011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2011\">Articuno</a>, <a href=\"/zapdos/3015-2140/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2140\">Zapdos</a> and <a href=\"/moltres/3015-2141/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2141\">Moltres</a> (which could only be acquired in the original Gold and Silver by trading with Red, Blue, or Yellow). Articuno and Zapdos can be found in their original R/B/Y haunts (Seafoam Islands and the Power Plant, respectively), while Moltres has decided to make its nest at Mount Silver.</p><p> </p><h4>Latios and Latias</h4><p>The player encounters the Hoenn champion <a href=\"/steven/3005-10235/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10235\">Steven</a> while exploring Vermilion city, who informs them that <a href=\"/latios/3015-1774/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1774\">Latios</a> (SoulSilver) or <a href=\"/latias/3015-1775/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1775\">Latias</a> (HeartGold) has been found roaming the routes of <a href=\"/kanto/3035-206/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-206\">Kanto</a>. The other Lati is not available normally but can be captured through a special promotional event.</p><p> </p><h4>Mewtwo</h4><p>In the original Gold and Silver, the Cerulean Cave had collapsed and could not be explored. In the remakes the Cerulean Cave is not only open, but <a href=\"/mewtwo/3005-6335/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6335\">Mewtwo</a> still dwells within.</p><h4> </h4><h4>Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza</h4><p>Similar to Latios and Latias, <a href=\"/kyogre/3015-1773/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1773\">Kyogre</a> (HeartGold) and <a href=\"/groudon/3015-1633/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1633\">Groudon</a> (SoulSilver) can be found hiding out in Johto and available for capture after a certain item is acquired. After acquiring the other through trading, Professor Oak will give the player an item necessary to summon (and hence, capture) <a href=\"/rayquaza/3015-1596/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1596\">Rayquaza</a>. Bring the civil war that nearly tore apart Hoenn in an ecological apocalypse to a new home in Johto!</p><h4> </h4><h4>Diagla, Palkia, and Giratina</h4><p>Though only available by transferring a special event Arceus to Heart Gold and Soul Silver, the three legendary dragons from Diamond and Pearl can be acquired in the remakes. Taking <a href=\"/arceus/3015-4087/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4087\">Arceus</a> to the Sinjoh Ruins allows the player to choose one of the aforementioned legendaries, each starting at level 1 and carrying its respective orb. Since the <a href=\"/giratina/3015-1395/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1395\">Giratina</a> acquired through this event carries the Griseous Orb (an item first introduced in Platinum, Which cannot be traded between games), this is the only legal way in Generation IV to obtain Giratina in its Origin Forme outside of <a href=\"/pokemon-platinum/3030-21676/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21676\">Pokémon Platinum.</a></p><h3>Version Exclusive Pokemon</h3><h4>HeartGold</h4><ul><li>Mankey-&gt;Primeape</li><li>Growlithe-&gt;Arcanine</li><li>Omanyte-&gt;Omastar</li><li>Spinarak-&gt;Ariados</li><li>Gligar-&gt;Gliscor</li><li>Mantyke-&gt;Mantine</li><li>Phanpy-&gt;Donphan</li><li>Baltoy-&gt;Claydol</li><li>Sableye</li><li>Anorith-&gt;Armaldo</li><li>Kyogre</li></ul><h4>SoulSilver</h4><ul><li>Vuplix-&gt;Ninetales</li><li>Meowth-&gt;Persian</li><li>Kabuto-&gt;Kabutops</li><li>Ledyba-&gt;Ledian</li><li>Delibird</li><li>Skarmory</li><li>Teddiursa-&gt;Ursaring</li><li>Mawile</li><li>Gulpin-&gt;Swalot</li><li>Lileep-&gt;Cradily</li><li>Groudon</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Spikey-Eared Pichu</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2709458\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3826219512195\" data-width=\"656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2709458\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-width=\"462\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png 656w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg 462w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.png 656w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/127698/2709458-5907971186-Notch.jpg 462w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-width=\"462\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Through Distribution at special events, a Pikachu colored Pichu from the event (Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum) can be transferred to Pokemon HeartGold or Pokemon SoulSilver Versions for a chance to catch a special Pichu. The way to do this is to take the Pikachu colored Pichu through Ilex Forest and near Celebi's Shrine/Protector's Shrine then watch as a Spikey-Eared Pichu comes to Ethan/Lyra (character). The Spikey-Eared Pichu may have to be captured in battle or if friendship is high enough with the Pikachu colored Pichu, it will let the player catch it with no battle.

Similarly, a <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a> port (outsourced to <a href=\"/logicware-inc/3010-784/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-784\">Logicware</a>) was canceled by Valve to avoid treating Mac users like \"second class citizens\".</p><p>Valve released an updated version of the original game, Half-Life: Source, which makes use of the <a href=\"/source-engine/3015-751/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-751\">Source Engine</a> to provide new water and physics effects, but did not feature a complete revamp of the game's assets.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Half-Life did little new in terms of control improvements at the time, but there were still many aspects of the genre that it revolutionized at the time of its release. The largest of these advancements was the lack of <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cut scenes</a>. The story was told through <a href=\"/scripted-events/3015-2039/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2039\">scripted sequences</a> that took place in real-time, in the same environment as the player. This lead to an incredibly immersive experience that players at the time had never seen before. Another important advancement in the genre was the lack of specified stages.</p><p>In a sense the whole game was just one big world, not split up into levels. Load times were short and were placed between certain doors or passageways. This little detail allowed the player to feel immersed in the story and the universe, and since the game took place in essentially one location, it made sense that each area was connected to the next.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1556490\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1556490\"><img alt=\"The game's protagonist, Gordon Freeman.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a><figcaption>The game's protagonist, Gordon Freeman.</figcaption></figure><p>At the beginning of the game Gordon Freeman, the protagonist, is on his way to work at the <a href=\"/black-mesa/3035-64/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa Research Facility</a>, presumably late, which is apparently commonplace for him. That day he is required to participate in a special experiment in the Anomalous Materials Lab in Sector C, where he is to push a <a href=\"/crystal/3055-445/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-445\">crystal</a> into the beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer in order to study it. Instantly, this causes a <a href=\"/resonance-cascade/3015-66/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-66\">resonance cascade</a>, where a <a href=\"/portals/3015-467/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-467\">portal</a> erupts between <a href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earth</a> and a world known as <a href=\"/xen/3035-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-75\">Xen</a>.</p><p>Freeman reawakens, partially clueless as to what has just happened. Backtracking through the facility, he meets some scientists who brief him on what is happening. According to them contact with the surface is fragmented, although a rescue team is said to be arriving shortly. This later turns out to be the HECU, or the <a href=\"/hecu/3015-5715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5715\">Hazardous Environment Combat Unit</a>, who infiltrate Black Mesa not to rescue but rather to kill everyone involved with the project. Freeman then begins his long journey through the facility, hoping to reach the surface. Along the way, it turns out that the facility has become a war zone between the <a href=\"/military/3015-1009/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1009\">military</a> and the Xen aliens. Freeman eventually learns about the Lambda Team -- who believe they have what it takes to reverse all this terror.</p><p>Along the way Gordon must launch a rocket satellite, with the intent of reversing the resonance cascade, by making his way through the underground, along a rail complex, to the satellite launch location. Gordon then redirects his path back to the Lambda Complex. At this time, the HECU begins to evacuate the facility, and commence air strikes. After that, Gordon no longer encounters military.</p><p>Finally, Gordon reaches the Lambda Complex. He has never been to this part of the facility, but learns a lot about the complex. This is where the technology to <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleport</a> to Xen was invented, and hopefully where the effects can be reversed. Though, Gordon learns from the few surviving scientists that the rocket satellite he has launched failed, and the only way left in order to reverse the effects is to go to Xen itself and kill the mysterious figurehead alien, <a href=\"/the-nihilanth/3005-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-648\">Nihilanth</a>. Gordon manages to get to Xen, and after a brief exploration through the planet, Gordon encounters the Nilhilanth. After destroying Nihilanth, Gordon is confronted by the mysterious <a href=\"/g-man/3005-421/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\">G-Man</a>.</p><p>G-Man can be spotted throughout the game, only briefly, to disappear around a corner and not be seen again. G-Man explains the situation through his fragmented English, stating his employers are interested in him, and that he believes Gordon has limitless potential. He then offers Gordon a job, which he may either reject or accept. If the player accepts, the G-Man is content with his decision, and makes it clear that this will <a href=\"/cliffhanger/3015-1010/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1010\">not be the last time</a> he will see him. If the player rejects, he is teleported unarmed to an area representing a place from Xen, surrounded by several Xen Grunts.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Half-Life features a host of both traditional and non-traditional weapons. The primary weapons that can be found throughout the game are as follows:</p><h3>Crowbar</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440345\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440345\"><img alt=\"The famous crowbar.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The famous crowbar.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1317/440345-crowbar.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The famous crowbar.</figcaption></figure><p>This melee weapon has inexplicably become synonymous with the <a href=\"/half-life/3025-293/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-293\">Half-Life franchise</a>. As a melee weapon, once guns are obtained it should really only be used as a weapon of last resort, and to save ammo when busting open crates and boxes.</p><h3>Pistol</h3><p>A basic handgun that can be found in many first-person shooters. The pistol in Half-Life is modeled after a Glock 17, and is replaced by a Beretta 92FS is the graphical overhaul that came with Blue Shift. The weapon isn’t too powerful, although headshots will quickly down enemies. If, however, the player uses the alternative fire method, then the 9mm fires a quick burst of rounds at the expense of range and accuracy.</p><h3>Magnum Revolver</h3><p>A <a href=\"/revolver/3055-1021/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1021\">revolver</a> that packs quite a punch. While it can only fire single shots, the magnum has a <a href=\"/scope/3055-738/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-738\">zoom</a> feature that can be accessed by pressing the alternative fire key. Using this zoom feature, the magnum becomes a medium to long range weapon and is far more effective then the 9mm at range. The revolver is modeled after a Colt Python .357 Magnum.</p><h3>Shotgun</h3><p>A weapon familiar to all first person shooter fans, the <a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun</a> is easily one of the most powerful close range weapons in the game. Using its alternate fire discharges two shells instead of one, doubling the damage potential but increasing the time between shots. The shotgun is modeled after a Franchi SPAS-12.</p><h3>SMG</h3><p>A <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">submachine gun</a> with an attached <a href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher</a>, a versatile weapon. The MP5 is a rapid fire submachine gun which is great at short to medium ranges. Its alternate fire, a built in grenade launcher, can be devastating, though ammo is limited and the player will be <a href=\"/splash-damage/3015-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-347\">injured by it</a> if too close to the explosion. In the Blue Shift graphical revamp, the MP5 was replaced by an M4 Carbine.</p><h3>Rocket Launcher</h3><p>This <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launcher</a> always hits its mark. The RPG in Half-life isn’t radically different from other shooters, but the special thing about this weapon is that its laser guided. This means wherever the player points the laser the missile will hit, making it a great weapon that’s also quite accurate, at the cost of making it impossible to \"fire and forget\", requiring the player to expose themselves to enemy fire until the missile hits its target. It does not feature an alternate fire.</p><h3>Crossbow</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440358-crossbow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440358\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440358-crossbow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440358\"><img alt=\"Half-Life's crossbow.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440358-crossbow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440358-crossbow.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Half-Life's crossbow.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440358-crossbow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440358-crossbow.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Half-Life's crossbow.</figcaption></figure><p>The most accurate weapon in the game, the <a href=\"/crossbow/3055-107/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-107\">crossbow</a>, in its primary fire mode, fires explosive tipped bolts. The player can greatly increase the range of the <a href=\"/crossbow/3055-107/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-107\">crossbow</a> by using its scope</p><p>(accessed by pressing the alternative fire key again) and by doing this the crossbow virtually becomes a <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle</a>.</p><h3>Tau Cannon</h3><p>The Gauss Gun is an experimental and highly unstable weapon. One of the weapons most important abilities is that it can shoot through walls, meaning no one is safe from its sights. The player can charge the gun up by using the alternative fire key and by doing this the gun will fire a more powerful shot, rather then several weaker shots.</p><h3>Gluon Gun</h3><p>Also known as the \"Egon\", this weapon is a product of Black Mesa’s Weapons Research Facility. The gun fires a constant <a href=\"/laser/3055-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-140\">stream of energy</a> which destroys most things in its path. The weapon's negative point is that shares its ammo with the Gauss Gun, and uses its ammunition very quickly if fired for too long.</p><h3>Hive-Hand</h3><p>An alien weapon that basically unleashes <a href=\"/animal-weaponry/3015-2027/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2027\">swarms of hornets</a> on the enemy. A good medium range weapon but weak in both long and close range. Its ammo regenerates after a few seconds, so it effectively has unlimited ammo.</p><h3>Snark</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440325-snark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440325\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440325-snark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440325\"><img alt=\"A Snark.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440325-snark.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440325-snark.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Snark.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440325-snark.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1317/440325-snark.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Snark.</figcaption></figure><p>These little critters are tossed at the enemy much like a grenade. If there are no enemies nearby, the Snarks will turn on the player, often resulting in a gruesome death. After a period of time the Snarks explode, and while this is a weakness, they are a great weapon partially because they are so much fun.</p><h3>Fragmentation Grenades</h3><p>Basic frag grenades are included in Half-Life as well, and tend to be fairly run-of-the-mill. They have a five second fuse and possess no alternate fire, but can be \"cooked\" by holding down primary fire for a length of time before releasing. Be careful not to hold it for too long.</p><h3>Satchel Charges</h3><p>Satchels are essentially remote-activate explosives, which are set by using the primary or alternate fire initially. The player can either choose to detonate the placed satchel, or place additional satchels. Detonating after placing multiple satchels will destory them all at once.</p><h3>Laser Tripmines</h3><p>These <a href=\"/trip-mine/3055-541/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-541\">mines</a> are attached to walls and, after three seconds, project a laser beam that causes the mine to detonate when the beam is broken, either by the player or an enemy. These mines can also destroyed if shot at directly, and are frequently used both online and off to block off paths and restrict player movement.</p><h3>High-Definition Pack and Weapons</h3><p>The High-Definition Pack changed several of the weapons in Half-Life, but the changes are mostly aesthetic improvements. However, a few weapons were actually changed into different guns, despite maintaining the same statistics; The MP5 was replaced with an <a href=\"/m4-carbine/3055-622/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-622\">M4 Carbine</a> with an attached M203, the Glock 9mm Pistol was replaced with a <a href=\"/m9-pistol/3055-940/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-940\">Beretta 92F</a>, and modeled the shotgun more closely after a <a href=\"/spas-12/3055-1364/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1364\">SPAS-12</a>.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Half-Life doesn't have levels per se, at least not in the normal sense of the word; instead, the player is given an on-screen title whenever a new area loads-- very much like in an interactive book. This apparently simple idea helped the player getting even more immersed in the Half-Live universe and story. Here's a list of those titles:</p><ol><li><b>Anomalous Materials</b></li><li><b>Unforeseen Consequences</b></li><li><b>Office Complex</b></li><li><b>We've got Hostiles</b></li><li><b>Blast Pit</b></li><li><b>Power Up</b></li><li><b>On A Rail</b></li><li><b>Apprehension</b></li><li><b>Residue Processing</b></li><li><b>Questionable Ethics</b></li><li><b>Surface Tension</b></li><li><b>Forget About Freeman</b></li><li><b>Lambda Core</b></li><li><b>Xen</b></li><li><b>Gonarch's Lair</b></li><li><b>Interloper</b></li><li><b>Nihilanth</b></li><li><b>End Game</b></li></ol><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Half-Life shipped with a <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">multiplayer</a> component that offered standard modes of play, including <a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch</a>. But its multplayer - and its popularity - got an enormous boost via the release of a free mod known as <a href=\"/counter-strike/3025-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-114\">Counter-Strike</a>.

Unfortunately, despite getting the unofficial nod from Valve that would allow them to complete the project without threat of legal action, Black Mesa seems to have been abandoned; the site has not been updated since 2009, and @BlackMesaDevs, the official Twitter account, has not posted since January of 2010.</p><p>The first part of Black Mesa Source was finally released on September 14 2012.

It continues the story of <a href=\"/gordon-freeman/3005-341/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-341\">Gordon Freeman</a>, a theoretical physicist caught in a disastrous <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleportation</a> experiment that becomes the catalyst for an <a href=\"/alien-invasion/3015-408/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-408\">alien invasion</a>. Despite his success in destroying the alien's apparent leader <a href=\"/the-nihilanth/3005-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-648\">Nihilanth</a> during the events of the original <a href=\"/half-life/3030-2980/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2980\">Half-Life</a>, Gordon finds himself conscripted by the enigmatic <a href=\"/g-man/3005-421/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\">G-Man</a> and placed into suspended animation. Several years later, Gordon is re-awoken for his next assignment: to disrupt the occupation of Earth by <a href=\"/the-combine/3015-64/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-64\">the Combine</a>, a powerful alien collective that has subjugated the remnants of <a href=\"/humanity/3055-5449/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5449\">humanity</a> during his long absence.</p><p>As with its ground-breaking 1998 predecessor, Half-Life 2 was released to overwhelming critical acclaim and commercial success, and it has frequently been cited for popularizing the use of <a href=\"/physics-manipulation/3015-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-88\">physics manipulation</a> in first-person titles to attack enemies or solve <a href=\"/environmental-puzzles/3015-3129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3129\">environmental puzzles</a>; the game's advanced facial animation system also garnered significant praise. It has earned thirty-nine \"<a href=\"/game-of-the-year-edition/3015-3825/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3825\">Game of the Year</a>\" awards and has been ported to <a href=\"../../xbox/60-32/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox</a>, <a href=\"../../mac/60-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mac</a>, <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> and <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a> platforms. Additionally, Half-Life 2 is included in <a href=\"../../the-orange-box/61-17729/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Orange Box</a>, a 2007 compilation title which also brought the game to <a href=\"../../xbox-360/60-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"../../playstation-3/60-35/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PS3</a>. Half-Life 2 is notable for being the first game to require installation of Valve's <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a> client, even for retail copies.</p><p>Subsequent follow-ups to Half-Life 2 were released as standalone <a href=\"/episodic-content/3015-1293/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1293\">episodes</a>. <a href=\"/half-life-2-episode-one/3030-14328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14328\">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a> and <a href=\"/half-life-2-episode-two/3030-9480/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9480\">Half-Life 2: Episode Two</a> each continue the franchise's overarching story while introducing a handful of new graphical and gameplay enhancements.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>While its <a href=\"/run-n-gun/3015-715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-715\">run-and-gun</a> <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> gameplay is very similar to that of the original, Half-Life 2 sets itself apart from many of its shooter contemporaries through the use of a robust physics engine (a heavily modified version of <a href=\"../../havok-physics/92-502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a>) which allows players to directly <a href=\"/physics-manipulation/3015-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-88\">manipulate</a> many objects throughout the game world. It also introduces the <a href=\"/zero-point-energy-field-manipulator/3055-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-20\">Gravity Gun</a>, a new physics-based weapon capable of picking up and launching most small or medium-sized objects with considerable force, potentially turning these mundane items into <a href=\"/improvised-weapon/3015-3091/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3091\">improvised weapons</a>. Most of the game's <a href=\"/environmental-puzzles/3015-3129/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3129\">environmental puzzles</a> are also built around this sort of object manipulation.</p><p>Protagonist Gordon Freeman spends the majority of the game on his own, exploring and fighting enemies solo; however, he is sometimes met by non-hostile <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs</a> who may provide dialogue or other forms of support. Late in the game's campaign, players are given the ability to command small <a href=\"/squad/3015-667/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-667\">squads</a> of armed human <a href=\"/resistance/3015-2542/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2542\">resistance</a> members as they fight through an embattled <a href=\"/city-17/3035-63/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-63\">City 17</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/204729-49375_1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204729\" data-ratio=\"0.74305555555556\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/204729-49375_1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204729\"><img alt=\"The G-Man revives Gordon\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1550/204729-49375_1_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/204729-49375_1_2.jpg 576w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/204729-49375_1_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1550/204729-49375_1_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The G-Man revives Gordon</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>\"So, wake up, Mr. Freeman.

Due to the somewhat ambiguous presentation, many of the finer details of the game's backstory are left for players to infer themselves.</p><p>The game is set roughly one to two decades after the events of the original <a href=\"/half-life/3030-2980/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2980\">Half-Life</a>, in which <a href=\"/gordon-freeman/3005-341/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-341\">Dr. Gordon Freeman</a> inadvertently caused a \"<a href=\"/resonance-cascade/3015-66/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-66\">resonance cascade</a>\" while working as an associate at the <a href=\"/black-mesa-research-facility/3035-64/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa Research Facility</a> in New Mexico. This catastrophic event heavily damaged the facility and triggered the <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleportation</a> of several hostile alien species into Black Mesa that immediately attacked the surviving personnel. Gordon battled through the aliens, as well as the US military's <a href=\"/hecu/3015-5715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5715\">HECU</a> soldiers sent to \"clean up\" both the invaders and any witnesses, in order to escape Black Mesa and close the dimensional portal before a full-scale invasion of Earth could take place. Eventually Gordon teleported himself to the \"border world\" of <a href=\"/xen/3035-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-75\">Xen</a> to confront the aliens' leader, a powerful telekinetic being called <a href=\"/the-nihilanth/3005-648/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-648\">the Nihilanth</a> that was maintaining the link between dimensions. Gordon destroyed the creature, seemingly ending the alien threat to Earth; however, he was immediately met by an enigmatic figure known only as the \"<a href=\"/g-man/3005-421/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\">G-Man</a>,\" who offered Gordon a job on behalf of his unknown \"employers\". The first game ends as Gordon is placed into some sort of stasis amidst a black void.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2946542\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2946542\"><img alt=\"City 17's train station plaza\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg 900w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"City 17's train station plaza\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg 900w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2946542-background_plaza.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>City 17's train station plaza</figcaption></figure><p>Half-Life 2 opens in the same void as Gordon is revived by the G-Man, who states that his \"hour has come again\". The G-Man inserts Gordon aboard a moving passenger train via teleportation; upon disembarking, Gordon finds himself in \"<a href=\"/city-17/3035-63/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-63\">City 17</a>,\" an urban <a href=\"/dystopian-world/3015-591/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-591\">dystopia</a> that appears to be the remnants of an unnamed city located in eastern <a href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe</a> or <a href=\"/russia/3035-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russia</a>. Although still populated by human inhabitants (as well as several <a href=\"/vortigaunt/3015-221/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-221\">Vortigaunts</a>), City 17 is controlled by <a href=\"/the-combine/3015-64/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-64\">the Combine</a>, a powerful collective of aliens that have conquered Earth in Gordon's absence. The city's oppressed populace suffers greatly under Combine rule; forced relocation between urban centers is commonplace, and omnipresent <a href=\"/metrocop/3015-6050/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6050\">Metrocops</a> constantly harass innocent citizens with violence and impromptu raids on residential blocks. Even humanity's ability to procreate has been denied by a Combine \"suppression field\" that is slowly driving their race towards extinction.</p><p>Gordon also learns that former Black Mesa administrator <a href=\"/wallace-breen/3005-1187/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1187\">Wallace Breen</a> managed to broker a deal with the Combine's leadership to have himself installed as Earth's puppet ruler in the immediate aftermath of the \"Seven Hour War,\" a decisive conflict between the Combine and humanity's military forces which ended with Earth's unconditional surrender. Breen surveys his citizens from the <a href=\"/combine-citadel/3035-731/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-731\">Combine Citadel</a>, a multi-kilometer-tall metal tower in the city's center that serves as the Combine's base of operations on Earth. His publicly televised \"Breencasts\" are little more than Combine <a href=\"/propaganda/3015-1664/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1664\">propaganda</a>, touting the relative safety of City 17 and extolling the virtues of Earth's new \"benefactors\" while condemning the weaknesses of humanity such as instinct, superstition and the urge to reproduce.</p><p>Gordon's sudden arrival in City 17 soon sparks a massive <a href=\"/resistance/3015-2542/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2542\">resistance</a> uprising, during which he and <a href=\"../../alyx-vance/94-640/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alyx Vance</a> manage to infiltrate the Citadel and destroy the \"dark fusion reactor\" located at its peak, ostensibly killing Breen in the process. Unfortunately Gordon and Alyx become trapped near the reactor's explosion; just before they are enveloped by the blast, time is apparently stopped by the G-Man, who arrives to once again place Gordon into stasis.

Its magazine and reserve are a bit short so it doesn't work well in extended engagements, but Combine soldiers in areas like Nova Prospekt all use them so this should be an infrequent problem in these places. It knocks out most targets in a second or two. The secondary fire for the Overwatch Pulse Rifle is an exposed fusion core launcher (again, is the whole thing really inside that little glass jar?) that releases a ball of swirling energy that bounces around and vaporizes anything it hits. These balls are hard to use tactically because of their sporadic bouncing pattern, but if there are enough enemies in the room, you're guaranteed to get a few of them.</p><ul><li>30 round magazine (60 in reserve).</li><li>Slightly less accurate than the SMG.</li><li>Ideal in medium-close range combat.</li><li>Exposed core launcher holds 3 rounds.</li></ul><h3>Shotgun</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637811\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.64696485623003\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637811\"><img alt=\"Shotgun\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg 626w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shotgun\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg 626w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637811-hl2_0027.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shotgun</figcaption></figure><p>The alpha and omega of close quarters combat in Half-Life 2. The <a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">Shotgun</a> is modeled in form after the Italian <a href=\"/spas-12/3055-1364/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1364\">SPAS-12</a> shotgun and uses readily available ammo. The pellet dispersion is far more realistic than in most games, meaning it works to greater ranges than you might initially expect. This range, combined with the hefty damage it doles out, makes the shotgun useful in many situations. Additionally, the secondary fire unleashes even more stopping power by firing the second barrel simultaneously with the primary barrel. Although this is a twist on standard shotgun functionality (as a shotgun's secondary barrel simply holds shells) it opens up new possibilities for hostile neutralization. If you find Half-Life 2 to be too easy, try playing through it without the Shotgun; you'll be surprised just how often its immense strength solves your problems.</p><ul><li>6 round magazine (30 in reserve).</li><li>Reloads one round at a time.</li><li>Accurate only at close range but usable at medium-close ranges.</li><li>Ideal at close range.</li></ul><h3>Crossbow</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637842\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.38280542986425\" data-width=\"1105\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1105px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:38.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637842\"><img alt=\"Crossbow\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 1105w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crossbow\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 1105w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Crossbow</figcaption></figure><p>An overly physics-inspired <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle</a>.

Unfortunately, the rod qualifies as a standard projectile, meaning that it has travel time and is affected by gravity. This forces players to make two separate corrections to their aim if firing at range: one for the drop in height and one to anticipate their target's motions. Thankfully, the crossbow at least has a right-click zoom function identical to the suit's except that you can actually fire while using it. The Crossbow is, ironically, hardest to use at sniping distances and is more than powerful enough to used against enemies in direct conflict. The ragdoll pinning is also always a plus.</p><ul><li>1 round magazine (8 in reserve).</li><li>Accurate at any range with proper aim correction.</li><li>Ideal at medium-long range.</li></ul><h3>RPG</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637814\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66469282013323\" data-width=\"1351\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1351px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637814\"><img alt=\"RPG\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 1351w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"RPG\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 1351w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>RPG</figcaption></figure><p>Arguably the most fun twist on a standard firearm in the game.

Hitting people with chairs, as it turns out, is very fun and the Gravity Gun's ammo is only limited to the number of movable objects in the area around you, making it useful from the time you get it to the end.</p><ul><li>No ammo.</li><li>Short range punting and long range grabbing.</li><li>Range of grabbed items up to long range depending on angle shot, medium if shot straight forward.</li></ul><h3>Grenade</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637843-hl2_0029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637843\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1160220994475\" data-width=\"362\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 362px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637843-hl2_0029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637843\"><img alt=\"Grenade\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" data-width=\"573\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637843-hl2_0029.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637843-hl2_0029.jpg 362w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Grenade\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637843-hl2_0029.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637843-hl2_0029.jpg 362w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" data-width=\"573\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Grenade</figcaption></figure><p>Another victim of the <a href=\"/havok-physics/3015-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok physics engine</a>. One would hope that the grenade would provide a surefire way to clear out a room full of baddies or at least shake them up before you storm in, guns blazing. Unfortunately, upon inspection, the Half-Life 2 grenade is a large cylinder. This means that the grenade's explosion may be nowhere near where you threw the thing in the first place; depending on how it lands, the grenade can roll a considerably long way (or it might not roll at all). Make sure that any grenade you throw explodes before moving into the area--you'll have no good idea where it will explode unless you can see it. The right-click flicks the grenade under-hand so it doesn't go very far, unless of course the grenade lands awkwardly at which point anything can happen.</p><ul><li>Maximum of 5 in reserve.</li><li>Completely inaccurate at any range.</li><li>Ideal if you don't get hit.</li></ul><h3>Pheropod</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637805\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9608938547486\" data-width=\"358\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 358px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637805\"><img alt=\"Pherapod\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg 358w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Pherapod\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg 358w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10392/637805-hl2_0036.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pherapod</figcaption></figure><p>After defeating your first <a href=\"/antlion/3015-252/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-252\">Antlion</a> Queen, a <a href=\"/vortigaunt/3015-221/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-221\">Vortigaunt</a> \"extracts\" these orbs of something from her and gives you an endless supply of them.

In its five year development, Half-Life 2 went through numerous delays, a massive source code leak, a lawsuit with its publisher <a href=\"../../vivendi-games/65-6398/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vivendi Universal Games</a>, and had to launch with the unproven and, at the time, unreliable <a href=\"../../steam/92-718/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam</a> digital distribution system.</p><p>The game is estimated to have cost 40 million dollars to produce. As revealed by the coffee table book <i>Half Life 2: Raising the Bar,</i> Half-Life 2 was originally intended to be a much darker, grittier experience where the <a href=\"../../the-combine/92-64/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Combine</a> are more evidently draining the Earth's resources and eliminating the surviving citizen population.</p><p>The settings of the game were also to be more diverse, with <a href=\"../../nova-prospekt/95-269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nova Prospekt</a> being a short stopping point but growing into the final destination.</p><h3>Source Engine</h3><p>For Half-Life 2, Valve developed a new game engine called the <a href=\"../../source-engine/92-751/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source engine</a>. The source engine includes a heavily modified version of the <a href=\"../../havok-physics/92-502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok physics engine</a> that allows for more environmental interactivity during both single-player and online play.</p><h4>Notable Technology</h4><ul><li><a href=\"../../hdr-high-dynamic-range/92-618/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High dynamic range rendering</a></li><li>Lag compensating network communications</li><li>Network-enabled and bandwidth-efficient <a href=\"../../physics-manipulation/92-88/\" rel=\"nofollow\">physics</a> <a href=\"../../havok-physics/92-502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">engine</a></li><li>Future-proof multiprocessor support</li><li>Facial animation system</li><li>Blended skeletal animation system</li><li>Full-screen <a href=\"../../motion-blur/92-248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">motion blur</a></li><li>Dynamic lighting and shadowing</li></ul><h3>Source Code Leak</h3><p>Half-life 2 was merely a rumor until being officially unveiled at <a href=\"/e3/3015-3168/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3168\">E3</a> May 2003. The game then received huge amounts of hype and won many awards for best in show. Initially the game had a release date of September 2003, but it missed that date. Leading up to the original September release date, Valve fell into an unexpected media blackout, providing almost no information whatsoever on the progress of the game as it was supposed to be being completed. After the September date had come and gone with no information from Valve, Half-Life 2's complete source code was leaked online along with other private internal Valve documents showing that the game was not yet complete and ready for release. Valve finally broke their silence and admitted that the game would be delayed for a year. This massive leak of private information was due to a major breach of <a href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve</a>'s internal network through a null session connection to Tangis which was hosted in Valve's network and subsequent upload of an ASP shell.</p><p>In June 2004, Valve issued a press release stating that the FBI had arrested several people suspected of involvement in the source code leak. Valve claimed the game had been leaked by a German black-hat hacker named Axel Gembe. Gembe later contacted Valve CEO <a href=\"/gabe-newell/3040-4498/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4498\">Gabe Newell</a> thinking that Valve wanted to employ him as an in-house security auditor, to which Valve feigned interest to bait him for arrest. He was to be offered a flight to the USA and then immediately arrested on arrival, but the German government learned of the plan and arrested Gembe themselves.</p><p>In November of 2006, in Germany, Gembe was sentenced to two years probation because the judge felt Gembe had a difficult childhood and was working on his problems.</p><h3>Continuing Support</h3><p>In January of 2012, members of the Steam Community group \"A Call for Communication (Half-Life)\" organized a massive community playdate called in Half-Life 2 to show their continuing support for Valve and the Half-Life franchise. Scheduled for February 4th, \"A Red Letter Day\" (an homage to Half-Life 2's second level) was intended to bring the game into the top ten most-played Steam games of the day by garnering as many concurrent players as possible. In total, the event put 13,126 players online at the same time, more than ten times that average for the past year.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

Having avenged the death of empress Jessamine Kaldwin and rescued their daughter Emily, <a href=\"/corvo-attano/3005-23124/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23124\">Corvo Attano</a> resumes his duties as royal protector for the new empress at the heart of Dunwall. Unfortunately a life of luxury behind palace walls has dulled the senses of tired and aging Corvo, while youthful curiosity of the outside world likewise distracts Emily from spotting a sinister plot brewing right beneath their feet. The sudden arrival of Delilah Copperspoon, the ostensibly estranged sister to the late empress and supposed true successor to the throne, springs forward a violent coup that sends our protagonists on the run. While in exile it is up to the player to eliminate Delilahs supporters one by one, weakening her treacherous cabal, all the while trying to determine the source of her powerful void magic and a way to break it.</p><p> </p><h3>Multiple Protagonists</h3><p>From the outset of the opening cinematic the player has the ability to choose who they wish to play as for the remainder of the game: Emily or Corvo. Once locked in there is no swapping back and forth and the story plays out from the perspective of the chosen protagonist. The primary difference between the two are the supernatural powers each character has at their disposal. Corvo retains an almost identical set of abilities from the first game with a few tweaks and additions, while Emily the newcomer to the franchise receives entirely different powers than those of her father. Apart from that the story plays out in the exact same order for both, with the exact same targets from beginning to end, with only minor dialog differences in certain situations.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2758490\" data-ratio=\"0.55840286054827\" data-width=\"1678\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1678px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2758490\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.png 1678w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2758490-emily_trailer_still_1434319206.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>While Emily may be the new protagonist and poster child for the sequel, it seems like the game was very much designed with Corvo in mind. The player encounters several characters from the past game that the royal protector had interacted with and has something to say about, but Emily can only mumble hearing about them from her father. Likewise the powers of Corvo seem more at home with the vertical level design - Blink being a satisfying line of sight teleport compared to the awkward Far Reach traversal ability that Emily uses which is clumsily aimed like an arched grenade toss and can be finicky to line up with higher ledges.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861163\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861163\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 3200w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 3200w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/21/217562/2861163-combat_01_web_1465773725.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Dishonored 2 is primarily a stealth game with the option to engage foes in direct combat. Broken up into nearly a dozen chapters, the goal in each one is to seek out the target and eliminate them in a lethal or non-lethal way. As these are usually key players in the organized coup against the throne, they're in well defended or otherwise fortified positions that require careful sneaking to reach to avoid a bloodbath in the streets. Although one of the selling points of Dishonored has always been the ability to fight and escape a detected state instead of simply quick loading a save (Quick Saves and Loads have also been integrated into the console versions of the game), stealth is usually the preferred option. Thankfully both Emily and Corvo have numerous abilities to help them along their way. Levels in Dishonored 2 offer multiple paths to the target with plenty of diversions along the way in the form of hidden upgrade runes, bonecharms, money used to purchase upgrades or simply pieces of lore about the world and it's inhabitants. There is a sense of verticality to each location, as it allow players to scale rooftops and bypass patrols overhead, or possess a fish and enter fortified buildings through the basement's pipework completely unnoticed.</p><p>Choice has always been paramount in the Dishonored franchise and the sequel is no different. It is possible to finish the entire game without being detected by guards and without having killed a single person, included the key targets in each level. For every key target the player can either kill them in a variety of different ways, or choose a more involved but simultaneously much more satisfying alternate option. During one of the early missions the player has the ability to turn a cruel machine against a genius inventor and ruin his mind instead of simply putting a blade through his back. They can even choose to deny the gifts of the outsider at the outset of the game and play through it entirely with no supernatural abilities apart from agility and gadgets.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Special Abilities</h3><p>Certain characters in the Dishonored universe can get marked by The Outsider, bestowing upon them supernatural abilities - as is the case in both the original game and Dishonored 2. While in the first game players were able to actively ignore their powers in a challenge to beat the game using only the sword, wits and the default Blink skill, Dishonored 2 actually gives the player a choice to completely reject the Outsiders mark, completely barring them from investing ability points in the supernatural abilities for the remainder of the game. Both Corvo and Emily share a common pool of \"Enhancement\" abilities that increase their jump height or lifebar, but each protagonist has their own unique set of supernatural abilities that drastically changes their approach to the already vastly replayable levels.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Corvo</h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>Blink</td><td>Corvos main traversal ability letting him teleport a distance forward. Can be upgraded to duplicate <a href=\"/daud/3005-25921/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25921\">Daud</a>'s Blink ability from the first games DLC which froze time completely when being aimed.</td></tr><tr><td>Possession</td><td>Ability to possess both living and non living bodies, as well as various animals. Can be upgraded to jump from host to host.</td></tr><tr><td>Windblast</td><td>An offensive blast of air that can be used to knock back grenades.</td></tr><tr><td>Devouring Swarm</td><td>Call forth a swarm of rats that can devour bodies and attack assailants.</td></tr><tr><td>Dark Vision</td><td>The ability to see enemies through walls along with their cone of vision. Can be upgraded to highlight items as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Bend Time</td><td>Initially enables Corvo to slow down time, but can be upgraded to stop it completely while letting the player retain free movement.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h3>Emily</h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>Far Reach</td><td>Emily's primary traversal ability that functions like the <a href=\"/devil-bringer/3055-4777/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4777\">Devil Bringer</a> from DMC4, sending out a ghostly claw that latches to surfaces and pulls Emily towards them. Can be upgraded to pull enemies towards Emily.</td></tr><tr><td>Mesmerize</td><td>Calls forth an object from the Void that mesmerizes (stuns) enemies for a short duration. Can be upgraded to increase the number of enemies it will transfix with it's \"gaze.\"</td></tr><tr><td>Domino</td><td>Links several characters together where an action performed on one will be duplicated on the others. Can be used in tandem with Emily's Doppelganger ability.</td></tr><tr><td>Doppelganger</td><td>Similar to <a href=\"/daud/3005-25921/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25921\">Daud</a>'s ability from the Knife of Dunwall, allows Emily to call forth a replica of herself that can either fight by her side or be used as a distraction.</td></tr><tr><td>Dark Vision</td><td>The ability to see enemies through walls along with their cone of vision. Can be upgraded to highlight items as well.</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow Walk</td><td>Turns Emily into a \"shadow beast\" that stealthily crawls along the floor and can easily bypass enemies. Can be used to crawl through vents in the same manner Corvo would access them by possessing rats.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>All of these abilities have several upgrade paths not fully listed above that expand their ranger or completely change how they function. Even if the player were to find and collect every single Rune throughout the entire game, they would not be able to fully max out a single characters skill tree.</p><p> </p><h3>Chaos System</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2758487\" data-ratio=\"0.55978584176086\" data-width=\"1681\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1681px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2758487\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.png 1681w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.png 1681w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2758487-bloodflynest_trailer_still_1434319203.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Making a return to Dishonored is the chaos morality system which affects the ultimate outcome of the game. The player can either play through the game as a ghost, never seen, never heard, avoiding combat and knocking guards out instead of killing them to get the \"good\" Low Chaos ending, or they can slaughter their way back to the throne earning themselves the rather dark High Chaos ending. Differences in terms of story are minor throughout the game, although they can see their character becoming more bloodthirsty throughout the story with their quirks and comments. There are multiple and varying endings dictated by player choices and the chaos rating which the player has accrued from start to finish, which are depicted in the form of short vignettes during the credits.</p><p> </p><h3>Karnaca</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2758493\" data-ratio=\"0.55794504181601\" data-width=\"1674\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1674px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2758493\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.png 1674w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.png 1674w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2758493-karnacavista_trailer_still_1434319221.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Along with a new character comes an entirely new location for the series. While the story begins in Dunwall, the story soon moves players to Karnaca, the \"jewel of the south\" and birthplace of Corvo Attano. Karnaca is a prosperous region that has a warmer climate and thanks to it's geographical attributes (mainly Shindaerey Peak) is able to harness wind as an energy source instead of solely relying on whale oil, which is said to be dwindling throughout the empire. As Dunwall was plagued by the \"Weeper\" plague, spread throughout the city by rats, the jewel of the south has it's own problems in the form of bloodflies. Quarantined apartments will have crimson colored nests sprouting from floors and ceilings, with swarms of these deadly insects that aggressively attack all who approach. These areas usually offer shortcuts that circumvent guards at the risk of getting stung to death. Similarly to the previous game, the amount of nests one encounters throughout a playthrough is dynamically determined by the amount of dead bodies they leave behind as narratively corpses serve as breeding hosts for the bloodflies.</p><p> </p><h3>Crafting</h3><p>Another new addition is a crafting system which is unlocked through the skill tree. In the Dishonored universe it is common practice for sailors to carve charms into whalebones that imbue them with special abilities. These charms can be found hidden throughout the game and help augment abilities by improving sneaking speed or regenerating mana from water fountains, for example. In Dishonored 2 the protagonist can craft their own whalebone charms by breaking down the ones they already own, memorizing their properties, and assigning them as they see fit. There are plenty of charms to find throughout the entire game, and while the locations are the same for both characters, the properties of of each differ. These special perks can be stacked up to four per charm, but unless they invest rune points into the crafting tree, the more properties they assign the bigger the chance of corruption which manifests itself in the form of negative side effects.</p><p> </p><h2>New Game Plus</h2><p>A month after release Dishonored 2 <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dishonored-2-free-update-adds-new-game-plus-mode-t/1100-6446378/\">received a patch</a> that enabled the possibility of a New Game Plus mode. After completing the story the player can start a brand new game by choosing a game-complete save, and retain all their ability points which can be redistributed anew, as well as all memorized whale-charms. New Game Plus mode also allows them to use both Corvo's and Emily's powers in tandem regardless of which character they choose to play. This allows the player to potentially play through the game multiple times until they've learned all available skills and abilities from both character pools. It is important to note that the player can only carry over spent ability points, so before finishing the game they should assign all ability points and sacrifice all charms.</p><p> </p><h3>PC System Requirements</h3><p><strong>Minimum</strong></p><ul><li>OS: Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit versions)</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-2400/AMD FX-8320 or better</li><li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 660 2GB/AMD Radeon HD 7970 3GB or better</li><li>Storage: 60 GB available space</li></ul><p><strong>Recommended</strong></p><ul><li>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit versions)</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-4770/AMD FX-8350 or better</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB/AMD Radeon RX 480 8GB or better</li><li>Storage: 60 GB available space</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p>",

Running on the <a href=\"/id-tech-6/3015-8504/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8504\">id Tech 6</a> engine, the game harkens back to the <a href=\"/twitch-aim/3015-4752/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4752\">fast-paced philosophy</a> of the early Doom installments, avoiding the slower <a href=\"/survival-horror/3015-4801/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival-horror</a> mechanics of <a href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\">Doom 3</a>. Along with a single-player campaign, the game features standard <a href=\"/weapon-slot-loadout/3015-2629/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2629\">loadout</a>-based multiplayer co-developed by <a href=\"/certain-affinity/3010-6279/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6279\">Certain Affinity</a>, and a detailed <a href=\"/in-game-map-editor/3015-269/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-269\">level creation</a> system co-developed by <a href=\"/escalation-studios/3010-6702/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6702\">Escalation</a> called \"SnapMap\".</p><p>Set on a <a href=\"/union-aerospace-corporation/3015-5646/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5646\">Union Aerospace Corporation</a> (UAC) research facility on <a href=\"/mars/3035-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4\">Mars</a> overrun by <a href=\"/demon/3015-557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-557\">the forces</a> of <a href=\"/hell/3035-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-24\">Hell</a>, the campaign puts the player in the role of the mysterious <a href=\"/silent-protagonist/3015-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-54\">silent protagonist</a> known as the <a href=\"/doomguy/3005-842/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-842\">Doom Slayer</a>. It follows him as he fights his way through the facility and through Hell itself to close the portals, while upgrading both his Praetor suit and his extensive array of weaponry.</p><p>A small chunk of the multiplayer portion of the game received two periods of beta testing: a closed beta in early April of 2016 for those who pre-ordered <a href=\"/wolfenstein-the-new-order/3030-42581/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42581\">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>, and an open beta two weeks later.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>At the Quake Con 2014 unveil it was revealed that the game focuses on high speed movement and run &amp; gun gameplay like the original Doom, and also features a deep combat melee system, including execution animations. There is no regenerating health system, thus the player will be forced to pick up health from fallen enemies in order to regain health. This gore kill system, initiated by dealing damage to enemies and then performing a melee attack, is meant to keep the action moving forward. The player is encouraged to play aggressively in order to re-supply and regain health.</p><p>Much like classic games of the '90s players will be able to hold all their weapons simultaneously, instead of the typical two primaries and a sidearm variant found in most modern shooters of today. Most major weapons have mods that can be attached by finding a modding droid within the level that add additional attacks such as the double tap for the super shotgun. One of the bigger changes is that both the chainsaw and BFG are assigned to their own unique keys and use unique ammo, making them go-to weapons for tougher foes or overwhelming odds.</p><p>Exploration will once again play a key role in Doom with secrets making a big return to the series. Each level will have various secret areas strewn throughout that reward the players with a variety of bonuses. These can range from getting weapons early, collecting armor upgrades that grant passive abilities, or discovering runes that allow the player to take part in instanced challenge rooms that unlock further gameplay abilities. The number of secrets available on each level can always be checked using the map, encouraging players to always go back and look around before moving on with the story.</p><p>id Software has stated that the campaign will be longer than 13 hours and feature an extreme difficulty mode called Ultra-Nightmare. During a play through in Ultra-Nightmare, a death is permanent causing the player to completely start their campaign over from the beginning of the game.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Certain Affinity co-developed the multiplayer which includes several classic modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, as well as freeze tag, domination, and warpath. Along with traditional gameplay modes, players can expect to locate power-ups, health packs, and jump pads in arenas that were familiar in older id Software games such as Quake. Players can also locate a pentagram that transforms them into a giant demon.</p><p>Doom launched with nine multiplayer maps, but included an in-game tool called \"Doom SnapMap\". SnapMap allows players to create new multiplayer maps and new game modes, which are all able to be shared to the online community.</p><p>Strong criticisms were cast during the multiplayer beta test due to the similarities to Halo's multiplayer from armor design to 2-weapon layouts instead of sticking with the more traditional arena modes found in previous games.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>At QuakeCon 2008, id announced that Doom 4 will not be available through <a href=\"/digital-distribution/3015-2329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2329\">digital distribution</a> like many of the company's previous titles. At the press conference, id Software co-founder <a href=\"/john-carmack/3040-4576/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4576\">John Carmack</a> announced that Doom 4 would have \"three times as much horsepower as <a href=\"/rage/3030-20672/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20672\">RAGE</a>\". The game was then said to run at only 30 frames a second, but despite this, Carmack promised to raise the bar on video game graphics to a level \"no one has ever seen before.\" Later in the event, id CEO <a href=\"/todd-hollenshead/3040-14696/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-14696\">Todd Hollenshead</a> contradicted Carmack in a way when he announced id is \"not even sure if Doom 4 will be Doom 4.\"</p><p>At Quake-con 2014 a private showing of the game wowed Doom fans, but no footage surfaced for the public's viewing pleasure. In a interview it was stated nothing would be shown until 2015.</p><p>In interviews John Carmack has implied that the gameplay was to be more action-oriented than the previous title, and looks to shy away from the survival horror elements of <a href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\">Doom 3</a>. Namely the dark environments, monsters 'hiding in <a href=\"/monster-closet/3015-1205/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1205\">closets</a>', and the relatively limited amount of ammo available.</p><p>Early interviews suggest this move away from survival horror to Doom's more traditional focus on action:</p><blockquote><p>You get to punctuate a lot more with triumphs and successes, and you just don't get to do that very much in survival horror. You know, you want to say, 'I'm victorious,' not, 'I'm not dead.' It's just a fundamentally more rewarding genre to be in.</p></blockquote><h2>Movie</h2><p>Personnel within id software have expressed interest in making a new Doom movie that actually follows the <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> storyline, unlike the original <a href=\"/tang-doom/2300-457/\" data-ref-id=\"2300-457\">Doom movie</a> starring <a href=\"/the-rock/3005-1674/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1674\">The Rock</a>. Todd Hollenshead has openly aired his interest in a possible Doom movie following the storyline of Doom 4 itself, whatever that may be. He hopes that the hype for Doom 4 will encourage Universal Studios into talks about the project's possibility.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Released two-and-a-half years after the original <a href=\"/silent-hill/3030-4312/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4312\">Silent Hill</a>, Silent Hill 2 is the first sequel to the 1999 original. Silent Hill 2 is the first game in the series to be released during the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> / <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> / <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> generation of consoles with its PlayStation 2 release in September 2001. It is also the first multi-platform game in the series, as Silent Hill 2 was released for the Xbox in December 2001 and the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in December 2002.</p><p>Other than some shared location names, including the titular town of Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2's story is entirely new and self-contained.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like the other Silent Hill games the character is controlled in a third-person perspective (except for <a href=\"/silent-hill-4-the-room/3030-6328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6328\">Silent Hill 4</a> where <a href=\"/henry-townshend/3005-3569/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3569\">Henry</a> is controlled via a first-person perspective during his time inside \"The Room\") while the protagonist explores different locations in Silent Hill and the town itself. As well as exploring James will have to complete different puzzles, battle many disturbing enemies, travel in the dark, and uncover the truth behind the town of Silent Hill and behind him and his wife's story.</p><p>Often the game is classified as <a href=\"/survival-horror/3015-4801/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival horror</a> - the player has limited resources at their disposal and has to conserve resources in order to survive; mainly <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammunition</a> and medical supplies.</p><h3>Locations</h3><p>Silent Hill 2 begins in a bathroom opposite <a href=\"/toluca-lake/3035-1391/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1391\">Toluca Lake</a>, some way from the town of Silent Hill itself. The first playable section leads the player on and on, through a forest trail eventually ending in a cemetery. After continuing through a long alleyway, the path eventually leads to the town of Silent Hill itself. Its predecessor, Silent Hill, had the player start on the streets of the deserted town.</p><p>The first street the player comes onto is the corner of Lindsey Street and Sanders Street. As with the first game, certain streets are blocked and it is up to trial and error from the player in order to find their way through their maze-like surroundings, hampered by the fog.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href=\"/james-sunderland/3005-724/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-724\">James Sunderland</a></h4><p>A widower and the game's main protagonist. James is introduced as a good-natured and kind man, though early on there are hints of his aloofness. He was working as a clerk when his wife died of a mysterious illness. It's later revealed that he euthanized his wife to end her suffering, and that it may not have been entirely out of compassion. The guilt of this act, which he has managed to block out, is what draws him to Silent Hill.</p><h4>Mary Sunderland</h4><p>James' deceased wife, who died before the events of the game. Nevertheless, she has managed to contact James with a letter and told him to meet her at Silent Hill. Despite the impossibility, James follows the letter's advice to Silent Hill to start looking for her. Mary was considered a compassionate yet reserved woman by those who knew her. Depending on James' choices throughout the game, either she or her doppelganger Maria fights a remorseful James for the game's final boss battle.</p><h4><a href=\"/angela-orosco/3005-1988/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1988\">Angela Orosco</a></h4><p>The first person James meets on his journey. Angela is first seen in a graveyard looking for her father. James meets her in various locations in Silent Hill. At one point she gives James a bloodied knife which the player cannot use as a weapon. It is later inferred that Angela was sexually abused by her father and she killed him in self-defense. Like James, she was summoned to Silent Hill because of her guilt.</p><h4><a href=\"/eddie-dombrowski/3005-6232/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6232\">Eddie Dombrowski</a></h4><p>James first meets Eddie in the apartment complex while he is in the bathroom vomiting, with a dead man stuffed in the refrigerator in the kitchen nearby. Eddie resembles James except that Eddie is much larger and tends to be aggressive and simple-minded in his responses. Eddie later reveals to James that he did kill the man in the apartment, as well as some of the other dead people James finds him with later. He kills those who make fun of him. Eddie attempts to kill James after he misinterprets a comment. As Eddie is dying he tells James that they aren't so different, and that \"they're not like other people\". He was summoned to Silent Hill after shooting a man and a dog, again spurred by guilt - though in this case it's implied that he feels more guilty about the innocent dog than the man.</p><h4><a href=\"/maria/3005-2939/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2939\">Maria</a></h4><p>James first run into Maria at Toluca Lake. She looks exactly like James's wife Mary \"apart from the hair and clothes\". Maria follows James on his search and they are often separated. Maria also is killed by Pyramid Head on a few occasions but always returns later with no memory of what happened. In truth, Maria is a seductive physical manifestation of James's wife that he created in his mind. The town of Silent Hill forces James to watch her die over and over again to punish him for his guilt.</p><h4><a href=\"/laura/3005-7001/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7001\">Laura</a></h4><p>Laura is an eight-year-old orphan that seems to be oblivious to the horrors of the town around her, and likewise is not affected by its changes to a nightmare landscape. She meets James outside of Rosewater Park and tells him that she knows his wife Mary and has a letter from her. Laura knows Mary from the Hospital where the two of them were staying and has a letter confirming this. Due to a bad first impression, Laura has trouble trusting James and frequently runs away when she encounters him.</p><h4><a href=\"/\">Ernest Baldwin</a></h4><p>Ernest Baldwin did not appear in the original Silent Hill 2 for the PS2, but was a character in the \"Born From A Wish\" mission on the Xbox version of Silent Hill 2 called Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams. All the extras in Restless Dreams were later released on the PS2 in the greatest hits version of Silent Hill 2. In the Born From A Wish scenario the main playable character is Maria, who wakes up in the bar she works in. Maria can hear Ernest on the other side of a door inside his mansion. Ernest tells Maria that he has lost his daughter, Amy, and asks if Maria will help him retrieve a few things. These things are in fact the items the cult used in a ritual to revive the dead. When Maria opens the door in the Mansion there is no one on the other side, implying that Ernest was a ghost.</p><h4><a href=\"/pyramid-head/3005-2442/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2442\">Pyramid Head</a></h4><p>Pyramid Head is seen throughout Silent Hill. A hulking figure with a giant knife and a red pyramid-like helmet on his head. Pyramid Head not only kills people but also kills the monsters of Silent Hill. In the time of the cult in Silent Hill, Pyramid Head was the cult's executioner. James' subconscious has used that image to create his own personal executioner because James wants to be punished for what he has done.</p><h3>Plot</h3><p>James Sunderland receives a letter from his wife, Mary, asking him to meet in Silent Hill, at their \"special place\". The only problem with this is that James's wife has been dead for three years, the victim of a mysterious illness. James feels as if he has been summoned to Silent Hill and returns to the fog shrouded town. Throughout his search James runs into a few other people the have been called to Silent Hill and all the while he is being stalked by a menacing creature dubbed Pyramid Head. As James travels through Silent Hill looking for his wife and their \"special place\" he gains insight on the town, as well as his own dark and terrible past.</p><h3>Endings</h3><p>Continuing the tradition started in the first game Silent Hill 2 features <a href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\">multiple endings</a>. Different endings are given depending on different criteria throughout the game such as, how long James ran, how many health items he used, conversations listened to or items looked at or collected.</p><h4>Maria</h4><p>James leaves Silent Hill with Maria. Before they leave, Maria coughs and James say \"We better do something about that cough\" echoing Mary's death.</p><h4>In Water</h4><p>This is considered to be the true ending to Silent Hill 2. James is seen picking Mary up and carrying her out of the room. The player can then hear a car door shutting and the car starting. James says \"Now we can be together\" and James drives his car into the lake killing himself. The credits are accompanied by the specific track of \"Angel's Thanatos\", Thanatos being the Greek mythological representation of death.</p><h4>Leave</h4><p>James leaves Silent Hill with Laura fulfilling Mary's wish to adopt her. The track played over the credits for this ending is \"Overdose Illusion\".</p><h4>Rebirth</h4><p>James collects the items needed to perform the ritual of rebirth. He is seen rowing out to a small island on <a href=\"/toluca-lake/3035-1391/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1391\">Toluca Lake</a> with his wife Mary dead in the boat. According to speculation, James was attempting to use the Ritual of Rebirth to bring back the cult god Samael and resurrect his wife. The track played over the credits is \"The Reverse Will\".</p><h4>UFO</h4><p>After using the Channeling Stone in the correct locations, space aliens come and abduct James. The whole ending is played in black and white. James meets <a href=\"/harry-mason/3005-1109/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1109\">Harry Mason</a> from the first <a href=\"/silent-hill/3030-4312/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4312\">Silent Hill</a> game and asks him if he has seen his wife -- to which Harry asks James if he has seen a little girl around.</p><h4>Dog</h4><p>James enters a room and finds a small dog at a control panel that appears to control every aspect of Silent Hill. The scene is spoken in Japanese. James falls to his knees and says \"It was you!\" The dog was behind everything. The dog licks his face and the credits roll with some very interesting music.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Common Enemies</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/lying-creature/3015-6012/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6012\">Lying Figure</a></li><li><a href=\"/mannequin/3015-6011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6011\">Mannequin</a></li><li><a href=\"/alchemilla-nurses/3015-5724/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5724\">Bubble Head Nurse</a></li><li><a href=\"/mandarin/3015-6009/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6009\">Mandarin</a></li><li><a href=\"/creeper/3015-6052/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6052\">Creeper</a></li><li><a href=\"/prisoner/3005-16607/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16607\">Prisoner</a></li><li><a href=\"/abstract-daddy/3015-6010/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6010\">Abstract Daddy</a></li></ul><h3>Bosses</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/pyramid-head/3005-2442/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2442\">Pyramid Head</a></li><li><a href=\"/flesh-lips/3015-6057/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6057\">Flesh Lips</a></li><li><a href=\"/abstract-daddy/3015-6010/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6010\">Abstract Daddy</a></li><li><a href=\"/eddie-dombrowski/3005-6232/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6232\">Eddie Dombrowski</a></li><li>Maria / Mary</li></ul><h2>Restless Dreams Port</h2><p>The Xbox version has the honor of being one of the first games in the library of <a href=\"/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a>'s first video game console, releasing just barely one month after the console launched. Not only that, but the Xbox version has exclusive content not available in the PS2 version. Xbox owners got to play a shorter side-campaign called \"Born From a Wish\" which allows the player to play a sub-story as Maria that focuses on events right before she meets James Sunderland in the main story. \"Born From a Wish\" became available to PS2 owners on the PS2 Greatest Hits version of the game that was released in November 2002. Silent Hill 2 was also certified as a Xbox Platinum Hit in February 2003.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817890-sh2os.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817890\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817890-sh2os.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817890\"><img alt=\"Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtracks\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817890-sh2os.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/817890-sh2os.jpeg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtracks</figcaption></figure><p>The original soundtrack was composed by <a href=\"/akira-yamaoka/3040-40927/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40927\">Akira Yamaoka</a>.</p><p><b>Tracklist:</b></p><ol><li>\"Theme of Laura\" – 3:26</li><li>\"White Noiz\" – 1:26</li><li>\"Forest\" – 1:46</li><li>\"A World of Madness\" – 1:49</li><li>\"Ordinary Vanity\" – 1:42</li><li>\"Promise\" (Reprise) – 1:47</li><li>\"Ashes And Ghost\" – 3:10</li><li>\"Null Moon\" – 2:52</li><li>\"Heaven's Night\" – 2:07</li><li>\"Alone in the Town\" – 2:22</li><li>\"The Darkness That Lurks In Our Mind\" – 1:18</li><li>\"Angel's Thanatos\" – 3:20</li><li>\"The Day of Night\" – 1:40</li><li>\"Block Mind\" – 1:14</li><li>\"Magdalene\" – 1:55</li><li>\"Fermata in Mistic Air\" – 2:19</li><li>\"Prisonic Fairytale\" – 1:57</li><li>\"Love Psalm\" – 4:29</li><li>\"Silent Heaven\" – 2:16</li><li>\"No-one Love You\" – 1:34</li><li>\"The Reverse Will\" – 3:35</li><li>\"Laura Plays The Piano\" – 1:57</li><li>\"Terror In the Depths of the Fog\" – 4:34</li><li>\"True\" – 3:09</li><li>\"Betrayal\" – 2:32</li><li>\"Black Fairy\" – 1:14</li><li>\"Theme of Laura\" (Reprise) – 1:53</li><li>\"Overdose Delusion\" – 4:33</li><li>\"Pianissimo Epilogue\" – 1:39</li><li>\"Promise\" – 4:40</li></ol>",

Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.</p><p>Utilising the notorious ''<a href=\"/tank-controls/3015-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls</a>'', players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the players view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. What is new over the original Resident Evil is the ability to now do an 180 degree turn, which was first introduced in <a href=\"/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a> and has continued as a mainstay across the series since then.</p><p>While the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the player is allowed to explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of the puzzles and necessary key items required to move on can be solved/collected in any order.</p><p>The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236034\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236034\"><img alt=\"Chris Redfield\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chris Redfield\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236034-character_select2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris Redfield</figcaption></figure><p>Like the original, Resident Evil features two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from. Each offers up a differing take on the same narrative, though what separates them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine's version of the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris's.</p><p>Jill has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional weapon exclusive only to her story, being the grenade launcher; she has with her a lockpick that can open locked drawers; and many more such examples. However Chris is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage before succumbing to death, and he also has better accuracy with handguns giving players the increased chance to pop a zombie's head completely just with one shot.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236033\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236033\"><img alt=\"Jill Valentine\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jill Valentine\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236033-character_select1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jill Valentine</figcaption></figure><p>Each character also has their own unique supporting character that they will often encounter and interact with during the game.

Each type of item requires only one slot, however. Each character also one additional slot strictly to house a unique item; Chris possesses a lighter, and Jill has a lockpick. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"/item-box/3055-6126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes</a> where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.</p><p>All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><h3>Self-Defense Items</h3><p>One notable feature exclusive to the remake is the addition of self-defense items. Given a separate inventory slot, there are three different self-defense items that players may find and then equip. Once one is equipped, from that point when a player is grabbed by an enemy, the player can then press the firing button which will then show the character using the self-defense item to escape the grab, canceling out any possible damage inflicted upon the character. All self-defense items are one use only, however.</p><p>There are three different self-defense items, one of which can be found by both characters, and one unique item for each:</p><ul><li><b>Daggers</b> - Can be found during both Chris and Jill's and will inflict moderate damage unto an enemy. There's a small chance that when the enemy has been shot, the dagger will fall onto the ground and can be collected once again by the player.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Flashbang</b> - Chris' exclusive self-defense item, Chris will shove the flashbang into the attacking enemy's mouth and, once shot by the player, will explode killing the creature completely.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Taser</b> - Jill's exclusive self-defense item, Jill will pull out the taser and then zap the enemy doing a high amount of damage. It will kill a zombie outright, though sturdier enemies such as hunters can sometimes manage to survive the current.</li></ul><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p>A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p>Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.</p><p>Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"/medical-herb/3055-566/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href=\"/first-aid-spray/3055-619/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p>Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris Redfield</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236303\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2\" data-width=\"2000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:200.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236303\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 2000w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 2000w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8497/236303-character_chris.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>One of the two main playable characters, Chris is the S.T.A.R.S.

The primary difference between the two is which characters are featured and what their role is. For Chris Redfield's story, he works alongside Rebecca Chambers amidst their attempts to survive the Mansion, whereas Jill Valentine has Barry Burton as her supporting character. However, both Rebecca and Barry do not appear in the other character's campaigns; Barry will at least still show up in the opening cutscene during Chris's story, but then disappears completely and isn't encountered again. And Rebecca Chambers is omitted from Jill Valentine's story completely.</p><p>Whichever of the two main characters the player selects, the other is then also absent from the majority of the game until the very end. The canon telling of the game's story is made up of varying factors of both interpretations, however, including the involvement of both Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton.</p><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661819\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661819\"><img alt=\"Barry, Wesker, and Jill\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Barry, Wesker, and Jill\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661819-dolphin-2012-09-27-00-31-23-08.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Barry, Wesker, and Jill</figcaption></figure><p>When the police received report of grisly murder cases happening in <a href=\"/arklay-mountains/3035-387/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-387\">Arklay Mountains</a>, a group called Bravo Team of <a href=\"/special-tactics-and-rescue-service/3015-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1450\">S.T.A.R.S.</a> is sent to investigate the report in 23th July, 1998; the group is formed by <a href=\"/enrico-marini/3005-3885/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3885\">Enrico Marini</a>, <a href=\"/rebecca-chambers/3005-1306/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1306\">Rebecca Chambers</a>, <a href=\"/kenneth-j-sullivan/3005-3136/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3136\">Kenneth J.

Though he has now decided to move on from Umbrella to continue his own nefarious ambitions, and only brought in his own S.T.A.R.S. team so as to collect combat data; he was also blackmailing Barry Burton by way of his family so as to lead the other S.T.A.R.S. members astray, though Barry will eventually break free of Wesker's hold and save his compatriots. Wesker himself is seemingly killed by his own creation the T-002 Tyrant--a hulking monster with a large, imposing claw--after he releases it to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. The team are then able to successfully kill the creature, place a bomb in the laboratory, and escape the resulting explosion via helicopter piloted by Brad Vickers, who had abandoned the team during the beginning in the forest once the undead dogs shown up.</p><h3>Alternate Endings</h3><p>Not only depending on which main character the player chooses, the endings of the game can also be determined by specific choices made throughout the game based on which characters manage to survive.</p><p>During Chris's story once the player returns to the Mansion after exploring the Residential building, Rebecca is forced into an encounter with a Hunter and screams for help; if the player can't reach her quick enough, she will die. If she survives, then Rebecca will able to set the bomb to destroy the mansion, triggering the resurgence of Tyrant on the Helipad. It'll slowly advance towards Rebecca and if the player isn't able to pull his attention away from her, it'll kill her instantly. Jill Valentine can also be left behind (and potentially killed for certain if Rebecca is still alive by that point) if the player isn't able to find the three MO discs required to unlock the door to her cell, and vice versa when playing as Jill herself.</p><p>During Jill's story amidst the Lisa Trevor boss battle, Barry Burton pulls his gun on Jill with what is insinuated to be the intent to kill her. During his hesitation, Jill swiftly pulls the gun from him and directs it back at him. However as Lisa Trevor closes in, Barry pleads that Jill hands him his gun. From here the player has the choice of giving it to him or not; if not, Barry will be killed. If so, then he will fight alongside Jill against Lisa. Though Barry may still be killed during this fight if Lisa gets close enough to knock him off into the chasm below.</p><p>If Barry survives the encounter, which sets in the motion the outcome of Wesker escaping and setting the Mansion to self-destruct, this triggers the ambush by Tyrant on the Helipad. It'll then slowly advance towards Barry and if the player isn't able to pull his attention from him, it'll kill Barry instantly.</p><p>Overall there are technically eight endings in total dependant on which combination of characters managed to survive the Mansion Incident, which also affects other such outcomes including whether or not the Mansion is destroyed.</p><p><b>Chris' Story</b>:</p><ol><li>Chris, Rebecca, and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Chris and Jill survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li><li>Chris and Rebecca survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Chris survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li></ol><p><b>Jill's story:</b></p><ol><li>Jill, Barry, and Chris survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Jill and Chris survive; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li><li>Jill and Barry survive; Albert Wesker escapes; the Spencer Mansion is destroyed.</li><li>Jill survives; Albert Wesker is killed; the Spencer Mansion is left as it is along with Tyrant.</li></ol><p>The canon ending of Resident Evil is again made up of varying factors across both stories, including the survival of Chris, Jill, Barry, and Rebecca, the destruction of the Mansion, Wesker's supposed 'death, and the hatred Wesker grows for Chris.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Survival Knife</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661782\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661782\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg 100w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661782-survivalknifechriss.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Considered to be a last resort tactic, the knife does very little damage and has dangerously small reach.

Though as one may expect, ammunition is terribly scarce.</p><h3>Colt Anaconda</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661786\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661786\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg 100w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661786-barrys44magnum.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Barry Burton's own custom magnum revolver, the Anaconda is pretty much the exact same weapon in both power and appearance as the Python.

However, the magnum ammo players find throughout the mansion isn't compatible with the Anaconda and as such becomes useless once all of its six rounds are used up.</p><h3>Self-Defense Gun</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661787\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661787\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg 100w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661787-selfdefensegun.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A small two-shot pistol, though with only one round left after the other was used by an Umbrella researcher to commit suicide, the Defense Gun is an unsuspectingly powerful weapon that packs about as much power as three shots from a Colt Python.

It can kill a zombie outright with just a single shot when aimed at the head, and it can even keep Hunters at bay as well. When facing against certain boss battles, like Plant 42, the character will be shown to aim down the barrel whereas they usually aim from the hip.</p><p>Acquiring the shotgun can differ slightly between Chris and Jill. Because collecting the shotgun will instigate the ceiling trap, Chris therefore requires the Broken Shotgun item to trade in its place. However Jill may potentially be able to collect it without the need for the Broken Shotgun.</p><p>Should Jill collect the shotgun, Barry will then arrive to save her from the trap. Though only if the player didn't meet Barry prior when finding the corpse of Forest Speyer, otherwise Jill will then require the Broken Shotgun item as well.</p><h3>Assault Shotgun</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661789\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661789\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg 100w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661789-assaultshotgun.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Richard Aiken's weapon of choice, the Assault Shotgun can only be attained if players manage to give him the serum to help remedy his poison infection in time. Richard doesn't give players his gun himself, however, and will instead be left as a 'parting gift' after he is killed either by Neptune (Chris's story) or Yawn (Jill's story).

When used as a weapon, it's decent at staving off Hunters as the continuous spray will cause the Hunter to rapidly flinch. Fuel quickly depletes, however, and no more can be found. A second flamethrower is also conveniently left outside the area where the player faces against the giant spider queen, Black Tiger. Once the player moves on from the underground sections, they cannot take the flamethrower with them as it is required to unlock the way out.</p><h3>Rocket Launcher</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661792\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661792\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg 100w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661792-rocketlauncher.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" data-width=\"100\"></noscript></a></figure><p>An old four-shot rocket launcher that is only available during the final encounter against the T-002 Tyrant.

Slow and sluggish in movement, but dangerous up close, zombies are durable enough against gunfire that they can prove to be extremely dangerous even just in small numbers. When encountered on their own, however, zombies can be dispatched relatively easy so long as the player has enough ammunition to spare. As per usual, zombies are best dealt with the pistol or sometimes the shotgun, which can kill a zombie with a single shot if the player aims directly at its head once close enough, or can at least reduce the zombie to a literal crawl by destroying its legs.</p><p>Zombies attack by grabbing and biting the player when close, but will also puke out acid instead if they can't quite reach the player. Some zombies will be encountered lying on the ground, seemingly pretending to be dead, and will grab at a character's leg should the player get close enough. However, the leg bite does little damage and will always result in the character killing the zombie with a single stomp or kick.</p><p>When encountered on stairs zombies are much less of a threat, as they won't attempt to bite the player and will simply rely on their acid vomit making them significantly easier to rush past.</p><h3>Crimson Heads</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2354682\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2354682\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2354682-crimson.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a></figure><p>One such infamous feature of Resident Evil are Crimson Heads. A significantly stronger, faster, and more aggressive variation of the regular zombies, the Crimson Head transformation will occur after a short while once a regular zombie has been ''killed''. The only way to halt the transformation is for players to burn the corpse afterwards (or kill a zombie by destroying the head) using a lighter and some gas fluid, both of which must be in the player's inventory for use. Otherwise after an allotted time, once returning to an area the now Crimson Head zombie will quickly spring into action and will forever persist in that area until it has been killed.</p><p>While Crimson Heads will place priority in hunting the player character down, they are known to also slash their way past any other regular zombies that gets in their way amidst their search.</p><h3>Cerberus Dogs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357195\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.93896713615023\" data-width=\"426\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 426px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357195\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg 426w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg 426w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357195-cerberus_re.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Alongside regular zombies, some sort of iteration surrounding infected dogs have persisted across nearly every Resident Evil game to date. Starting at the beginning, so to speak, the Cerberus Dogs of Resident Evil are infected Doberman breeds, purposely engineered to be a form of B.O.W. Cerberus dogs retain the same agility and tenacity as a regular dog, though with a massive increase in aggressiveness, brutality, and stamina.</p><p>Like zombies, Cerberus dogs are best left for lesser weaponry like the pistols and shotguns. Running past is always an option as well, as both Chris and Jill are just ever so slightly faster than the canines. However their attacks can sometimes cover just enough distance to close the gap and catch the player character.</p><h3>Web Spinners</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357199\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.60860215053763\" data-width=\"465\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 465px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357199\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg 465w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg 465w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357199-giant_spider.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Giant, hairy spiders, the Web Spinners are a tenacious foe across Resident Evil, though they primarily appear only briefly within the Residential building. They can crawl along walls like any other spider, and will often try to charge forward and bite players when given the opportunity. However, their greatest weapon is their poison spit, which they will routinely spray; it has a fairly long reach of attack and has a high chance of poisoning the player, though the base damage it inflicts isn't quite as alarming. Before they fire their spit, they can first be heard to be readying it within their body.</p><p>Web Spinners have surprisingly tough hides and are most susceptible to the Grenade Launcher - specifically when equipped with flame rounds. They will also often strafe once they've been shot and attempt to counter the player as such. If a Web Spinner is killed with its sack intact, a large multitude of baby spiders will seep out of the corpse and attack the player. Though their damage is even less than that of a crow and should the player leave the area, they will return to find them all gone.</p><h3>Hunters</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357193\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4464285714286\" data-width=\"560\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357193\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg 560w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg 442w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg 560w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357193-hunter.jpg 442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></noscript></a></figure><p>First appearing once players return to the Mansion after investigating the Residential building, Hunters will then replace the common zombies of the game and will be encountered throughout in most areas where the zombies originally populated. Hunters are extremely dangerous and one of the most antagonising enemies throughout the franchise, let alone Resident Evil. They attack using their sharp claws and their most common source of attack is to leap through the air and slash the player. Though the player can still manage to shoot the Hunter mid-jump if they react fast enough.</p><p>Should the character's health be in the Caution state or lower, however, the Hunter's dive will be replaced with a swift cleave which will decapitate the character killing them instantly. Though they will at least let out a distinctive shriek first to notify players they are preparing such an attack. Hunters take one, sometimes two, shots from the Colt Python, which makes for the most suitable weapon. Otherwise the grenade launcher, and even the shotgun, can do the job if there's enough distance between the Hunter and the player. However Hunters are almost always encountered in groups of at least two.</p><h3>Chimera</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357196\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"330\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 330px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357196\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg 330w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357196-chimera_remake.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Encountered only within the secret underground laboratory, Chimeras are wretched creatures made up of both human and fly DNA. Like Hunters, these too were artificially created by Umbrella themselves, though they apparently proved to be unreliable and not as effective as the Hunter B.O.W. They primarily function like a cross between Web Spinners and Hunters; Chimera's can scuttle across flat surfaces, and will usually try to slash the player from above, but will also land into the floor and give chase. From this stage, Chimera's may possibly leap onto the character's back and slice them from there.</p><p>They can be relatively easy to avoid, however--especially if they've following whilst on the ceiling--and typically take around 2-3 shotgun rounds should direct combat come to pass. Though much like the Hunters, Chimera are rarely encountered alone and they will sometimes attempt to swarm the player as a pairing by attacking from two different directions.</p><h3>Adders</h3><p>Highly aggressive poisonous snakes, Adders can be found throughout the Mansion garden and will drop from the trees landing in front of the player. The damage they do is minimal, though there's a high chance they can poison the player and there's often a large number of them at that. Running past them is the best option, however due to their size they can be difficult to distinguish. If the player decides on combat they will at least die by but a single handgun shot.</p><h3>Wasps</h3><p>Found in the Residential building, a sizeable wasp cocoon has formed within. Though the wasps themselves do very little damage and die with at most 2 shots from a handgun, they will continually respawn until the player can find the item required to put an end to the wasp cocoon.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Crimson Head Prototype</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357197\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0239361702128\" data-width=\"376\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 376px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357197\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-width=\"625\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg 376w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357197-crimson_head_elder.jpg 376w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-width=\"625\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The first zombie that underwent the Crimson Head transformation, Umbrella scientists managed to restrain it and locked it underground in a tomb. Once released by the player, it soon awakens and begins chase just as the gate is closed behind to stop the player from escaping. The Prototype functions much like an ordinary Crimson Head zombie; it'll run at the player and attempt to swipe with their claws, however it will always use its right claw, allowing the player to avoid its attack if they run to the left. It will continue this routine until it dies, which only requires around 4-5 shotgun shells on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Yawn Part I</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357191\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79110251450677\" data-width=\"517\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 517px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357191\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png 517w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png 517w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2357191-pachislot_yawn.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A monstrously huge snake that resides within an attic, Yawn will surface once the player enters in search of a crest. This battle is completely voluntary, however, as the player can attempt to just collect the crest and escape. Because of the snake's size, this can sometimes prove difficult. If the player is bitten there's a high that they'll be poisoned. If the player's poisoned, the character will pass out once they escape the room.</p><p>As Jill, she will pass out and fall to the ground, with Barry arriving soon after who will take her to the first floor save room. This is all done instantaneously amidst a black screen, however, and Jill will wake up to find Barry gone. As Chris, he too will pass out just as he leaves the area and will be greeted by Rebecca Chambers. However in this occurrence, the player takes control of Rebecca and must collect the serum from the first floor medicinal save room for Chris within 7 minutes, otherwise he will die and the game will be over. Fighting Yawn can be tricky because of its size and its stamina; it will generally require around 10 shotgun shots or 4-5 grenade launcher rounds on the Normal difficulty to force it to flee.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400172\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77011494252874\" data-width=\"435\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 435px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400172\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg 435w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg 435w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400172-yawnuc.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Also to note is during Jill's playthrough, and if the player manages to save Richard Aiken from his poison infection, once the player goes to fight Yawn Richard will join soon after equipped with his custom Assault Shotgun. From there he will assist the player if they choose to attack Yawn; after so much damage, Yawn will recede away, but will strike again once Jill and Richard lower their guard and will swallow Richard whole. If the player instead chooses to ignore Yawn and collect the crest and leave, Richard will scream after no doubt suffering the same fate. If players fight alongside Richard until his inevitable death, they will then be able to collect his assault shotgun - the cutscene of Richard pushing Jill out of the way depicts him dropping his shotgun at the last second. However should players abandon Richard, then the shotgun is presumably gobbled up by Yawn alongside Richard and cannot be collected</p><h3>Yawn Part II</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400175\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400175\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400175-resident_evil_remake_giant_snake_boss_yawn.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Located in the library, Yawn will resurface after the player while they're looking for a specific book. Yawn functions exactly like it did in the previous battle and will slither throughout the environment in its attempts to bite and poison the player. Unlike the first encounter, this battle is mandatory as finally killing Yawn is the only way to trigger it knocking the bookcase and revealing a book the player needs.</p><p>If the player is poisoned this time they are left to carry on without any assist. Though by this point blue herbs to cure the poison are now accessible and can be found throughout the mansion. Any of the damage inflicted on Yawn previously will have had no effect and Yawn now requires a significant amount more punishment to beat.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part I</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-528029\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-528029\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5322/528029-lisa_about_to_hit.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Lisa Trevor is a new character and boss specifically created for the remake. She is a young teen girl, but one that underwent extensive testing and experimentation with a number of viruses turning her into a hunchbacked monster. Lisa was actually the precursor for the Nemesis project seen in <a href=\"/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3,</a> though unlike Nemesis, Lisa cannot be controlled.</p><p>The first time Lisa is encountered is when the player enters the nearby cabin in the woods and is ambushed by Lisa knocking the player character out. Once the character comes to, they quickly take notice of Lisa Trevor as she slowly limps toward the player. Lisa is invincible and can only be temporarily warded for a couple of seconds; this can help the player escape the cabin, which at this point in time is the only option the player has. Lisa's attacks can do a great deal of damage at that and can kill both Chris or Jill in just 3 hits on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part II</h3><p>Encountered within the Caves/Mines underneath the Mansion, Lisa Trevor functions as she did before and cannot be killed. Once again the player is to avoid all encounters with Lisa, though this time the player must also attempt to pull a couple of levers necessary to continue on. Like before, the player can attack Lisa enough that she may very briefly become incapacitated to allow the player past. The area is filled with a series of narrow pathways, however, which can make trying to run past Lisa head on practically impossible. Though there are multiple passageways that offer opportunities for the player to skirt Lisa and work their way around her.</p><h3>Lisa Trevor Part III</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400177\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4035087719298\" data-width=\"342\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 342px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400177\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg 342w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400177-trevor_front.jpg 342w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The final encounter with Lisa, Chris/Jill will arrive in a cavern and will be greeted by Albert Wesker as Chris and Barry Burton as Jill. As Chris, Wesker greets Chris and asks him to ''get a piece of the action''. During this battle, Wesker will attempt to help Chris in warding Lisa off.</p><p>There are two ways to beat this battle. Because the area is made of a small square platform surrounded on its left and right side by what looks like a endless pit, the player can potentially do enough damage to force Lisa off the edge, though this requires a fair amount of damage inflicted unto Lisa. Otherwise the player can attempt to manoeuvre around the area pushing the stones off of the surface; once all four have been pushed off, this will open the coffin in the middle that contains the remains of Lisa's mother. The sight of her mother will drive Lisa to temporarily express the one small piece of humanity she has left as she cries in vain at her mother and leaps off into the abyss with a shriek.</p><p>With Jill this battle plays out the same, though the opening will offer the player a choice to hand Barry his custom magnum after handily taking it off him after he threateningly directed it at Jill. If the player chooses Yes, then Barry will fight alongside Jill; if No, then Lisa will knock Barry off killing him, forcing Jill to fight alone but also letting her keep Barry's fully loaded magnum revolver.</p><p>When fighting against Lisa she uses the same array of attacks. Though the tactic for knocking her off works both ways as she too can not only knock the player off, but also their AI ally. If Barry is knocked off he is then declared dead for the ending. However, if Wesker is knocked off he will still appear during the end as per usual. Wesker surviving the drop is never brought up nor explained later in the game.</p><h3>Neptune</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400182\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.68834080717489\" data-width=\"446\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 446px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400182\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg 446w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg 446w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400182-re_neptune.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>An even more aggressive breed of shark, Neptune is a great white infected with the T-Virus and is the most unconventional boss battle in the game as the player doesn't actually fight it. Once entering the aqua tank, the player will be enveloped in knee high water which will slow their character's movement speed. The player is to quickly run across the walkway into the control room before Neptune leaps out and attacks; the music will quickly rise in tempo and urgency to let the player know how close Neptune is to attacking. It's possible to avoid Neptune, but if it is in reach of the player it will quickly pull the player into the water killing them instantly.</p><p>Once the player has reached the control room, and has climbed down the ladder, they'll now be underwater, faced by Neptune on the opposite side of the window. Neptune will then attempt to break the glass, forcing the player to configure the settings in the control room to close the shutters over the window before Neptune smashes through the glass. Once that's done, and the water has been drained, the player will leave the room leading into the ground floor of the tank. Along the way the player will encounter two lesser infected sharks which are barely clinging to life within the oxygen. The player may choose to mercy kill them, though it's not necessary.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400184\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400184\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400184-full.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Eventually the player will reach Neptune, who is surfaced within a small pool of shallow water. It is completely docile for the time being, but once the player tries to grab a key they require on a platform past Neptune, it will spring into action and attempt to attack the player. Neptune cannot move, but the player is trapped on the small raised platform. Pushing the circuit box into the water and turning on the power will then kill Neptune completely, allowing the player to move past safely.</p><p>As Jill the scenario plays out as such, though when playing as Chris, and if Richard was cured of the snake poison inflicted by Yawn, Chris will encounter Richard as he first enters the tank. Richard will then quickly push Chris out of the way -- saving him from Neptune's attack, but dying in his place. Once the player has drained the tank, they can collect Richard's custom shotgun on the tank's ground floor.</p><h3>Plant 42</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400178\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.97229916897507\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400178\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png 361w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png 361w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400178-pachislot_plant_42.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A huge and incredibly hostile plant that has been infused with the T-Virus. Dubbed Plant 42 for being located within ''Point 42'', the carnivorous plant has entrenched itself within the Residential Building and uses its vines to attack its prey throughout the building via small holes in the floors, walls and ceiling. If the player nears any of these holes, the plant's vine will attack and attempt to strangle the player until they waggle it off by mashing on the buttons. Once the body of the Plant has been located, this initiates the boss battle. Large in size, reaching the ceiling at around 12ft in height, it primarily attacks by using its vines to squirt small droplets of acid, though it will also attempt to attack the player by swiping them with its vines as well.</p><p>The best strategy is for the player to climb up the stairs reaching what remains of the second floor and shoot at the bulb. After enough damage, it will recede only to quickly sprout back out. As Jill, once this occurs Barry will arrive conveniently equipped with a flamethrower and will lay waste to the creature killing it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400179\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2400179\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2400179-plant421_gamecube_res.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As Chris, the player may need to continue fighting from this stage until it's killed. However, if the player managed to save Richard, then as soon as Chris enters the room he will quickly be grabbed by the creature, just as Rebecca arrives on the scene. Chris will then hand her a file to help in creating the ''V-Jolt,\" a type of poison that will kill the plant. Now controlling Rebecca, the player is to head to the nearby chemistry room and make the concoction. With the V-Jolt made, the player must then find the roots within the building and administer the V-Jolt, which will weaken Plant 42 as before, releasing Chris.

It functions like its smaller kin of spiders, though its poison spit is more ferocious and will actually shoot three splashes at once with a greater range. The environment is relatively small, which allows the player to run around the creature to keep out of its poison distance. The shotgun, grenade launcher and magnum work as expected, though Black Tiger is especially weak to flame rounds shot from the grenade launcher. As Chris, the player will have a flamethrower available which is also effective. Alongside Black Tiger are two regular Web Spinners as well that have the same attributes as previously encountered Web Spinners</p><p>Once killed, a multitude of small spiders will begin to seep out of its corpse, though leaving the area and returning will remove them from the area.</p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part I</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357192\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5748299319728\" data-width=\"294\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 294px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2357192\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-width=\"294\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg 294w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2357192-re_tyrant.jpg 294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-width=\"294\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Wesker's betrayal is revealed, he (or Barry accidentally) will release Tyrant, where it will proceed to slowly walk towards the player. The battle itself is relatively simple as it will only walk towards the player, though it won't flinch against any gunfire. Keeping Tyrant at a safe distance, while circling the large lab equipment, the player should be able to down the monster without taking any damage so long as they have enough ammo. Tyrant is unsurprisingly thick skinned and requires a fair amount of ammunition; the magnum alone will still take around 8 rounds to put down on the Normal difficulty.</p><h3>Tyrant T-002 Part II</h3><p>The final battle of the game, this second encounter with Tyrant is only triggered should the player have Barry or Rebecca alive, otherwise this battle will be skipped altogether and Brad Vickers will arrive to pick up the remaining characters.</p><p>Otherwise it will erupt from the ground on the heliport and its gameplay design will have now changed drastically. No longer content in steadily walking towards the player, Tyrant will now routinely break into a quick sprint and swipe with its massive claw at the player dealing a great deal of damage. With Barry or Rebecca at their side, the player at least has some backup. Though they too can be killed by Tyrant and must also reload when necessary. After Tyrant has received enough damage, or the timer that is ticking down has reached around 30 seconds, Brad Vickers will drop down a rocket launcher the player must use to kill Tyrant.</p><p>Equipped with only four shots, the Tyrant will manage to deflect the first, though the second will score a direct hit destroying the Tyrant completely.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p>Resident Evil contains just about all of the original version's suite of unlockables and some of its own original inclusions.</p><h3>Costumes</h3><p>Getting the Happy ending (with all three characters surviving the Mansion Incident) will gift a key that the player begins with in their inventory once they load their completed save.

The game will play out as usual, however the zombified Forest Speyer will sporadically appear in certain areas and will give chase. Forest will function like an ordinary zombie and will try to grab and bite the player, though he runs at the speed of a Crimson Head. The player cannot attack Forest in any way, either, as he has a bandoleer of grenades strapped around his torso and any attacks will cause him to explode -- killing the player instantly regardless of the distance.</p><p>Because Forest is travelling around the mansion and has already reanimated, he will of course not be found in the outside balcony as per usual. Forest will also only be encountered within the Spencer Mansion and will not follow into the other environments across the game. There is no way to turn off this mode and the player must start a new save to play without the stalking of Speyer.</p><h3>Invisible Enemy Mode</h3><p>Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, the Invisible Enemy Mode is as self-explanatory as they get -- all of the enemies within the game, bosses included, are invisible to the player. There is no longer any auto aim at that, though they will make their typical sound effects once the player is in the location. The player's unlockable weapons/costumes will not carry over into this mode.</p><h3>Real Survivor Mode</h3><p>Unlocked by completing on any difficulty in any time, Real Survivor mode was initially a prototype mode for the original Resident Evil. Its notary difference is that the item boxes no longer share items and any items stored in one particular box will forever stay exclusively in that one box. Auto aim is also disabled and the gameplay modifiers are set within the Hard mode settings.</p><h2>HD Remastered Port</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2692550\" data-ratio=\"0.56229508196721\" data-width=\"610\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2692550\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg 610w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg 610w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2692550-residentevilremakevideo610.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Announced on August 5th, 2014 was an HD port version of the Resident Evil remake for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Its pre-rendered backgrounds are to be upscaled (720p on PS3 and Xbox 360; 1080p on PS4 and Xbox One), though certain objects and even whole areas were redone completely in polygons.</p><p>Character models are redone in HD, and it also allows players to select between 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. However when playing in 16:9 the screen will crop the image and then pan up/down depending on the direction the character moves.</p><p>While the game still offers the classic tank control scheme, more modernized analogue controls are also be available as an alternative -- to which the player can switch between in real-time.

Upon doing so would add to the overall infection percentage shown on the site; sharing the user's status on such social media sites as facebook or twitter would also help further the infection.</p><p>Capcom later announced that should the infection reach 100%, they would include Chris and Jill's BSAA outfits from <a href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5</a> in the game, though Chris's his Lost in Nightmares outfit as opposed to his default RE5 attire.</p><p>On September 26th, the ''infection'' officially reached 100%, assuring that the new costumes were to appear in the HD Remastered port. The costumes are unlocked at the outset and can be selected within the character select menu, which is also now how the other unlockable costumes of the game are to be selected as well.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>To better connect this game with narrative advancements of later games, Resident Evil spliced in some additional story details that were absent from the original. One of the more noticeable ones is the addition of <a href=\"/george-trevor/3005-11814/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11814\">George</a> and <a href=\"/lisa-trevor/3005-6121/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6121\">Lisa Trevor</a>. George designed the Arklay Mansion which ultimately ended up being his grave and his daughter Lisa was the subject of Umbrella's hideous experiments and will be encountered by the player at various times through the game. These additions were scrapped from the original game but have been added in to give the Resident Evil mythos some more depth. Other such additions include the mention of <a href=\"/william-birkin/3005-3332/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3332\">William Birkin</a> and <a href=\"/alexia-ashford/3005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4456\">Alexia Ashford</a>.</p><p>There were also several new locations created for the remake such as the Graveyard behind the secret door in the main hall and Lisa's Cabin in the Courtyard. These extra locations gave the game new puzzles that the player would find a new challenge even if they played and completed the original. Even puzzles that were ported over from the original were remixed, as were enemy placements and the general design of the mansion was reworked in places so as to give the mansion the feeling of nostalgia, yet with plenty of surprises for veterans of the series.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>MINIMUM</h3><ul><li>OS: Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 8.1</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz, AMD Athlon X2 2.8 GHz, or better</li><li>Memory: 2 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX260, ATI Radeon HD 6790, or better</li><li>Monitor Resolution: 1024×768 or higher</li><li>DirectX: Version 9.0c</li></ul><h3>RECOMMENDED</h3><ul><li>OS: Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 8.1</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad 2.7 GHz, AMD Phenom II X4 3.0 GHz or better</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560, ATI Radeon HD 6950, or better</li><li>Monitor Resolution: 1280×720 or higher</li></ul>",

She is inadvertently captured by Umbrella, however, although a conveniently timed attack unto the base she is held allows her a chance to make her escape.</p><p>Code: Veronica X, which was released only a year later on PlayStation 2, is an upgraded port from the original Dreamcast release. It plays the exact same, though it features a couple of added cutscenes--both involving the series sinister villain <a href=\"/albert-wesker/3005-627/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-627\">Albert Wesker</a>--and minor graphical updates, including <a href=\"/steve-burnside/3005-4453/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4453\">Steve Burnside</a> receiving a redone hairstyle.</p><p>Code: Veronica X is thusly viewed as the 'true' rendition of the game and is the version that was ported over to the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a>, and which underwent the HD treatment with the Resident Evil Revival Collection alongside <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overview &amp; Controls</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/320017-resicvx_006_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-320017\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/320017-resicvx_006_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-320017\"><img alt=\"Code: Veronica is notable for featuring 3D environments as opposed to pre-rendered\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/320017-resicvx_006_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/320017-resicvx_006_large.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6974/320017-resicvx_006_large.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/320017-resicvx_006_large.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Code: Veronica is notable for featuring 3D environments as opposed to pre-rendered</figcaption></figure><p>Much like previous main Resident Evil entries, Code: Veronica mixes in third-person combat, exploration and puzzle solving. Code: Veronica only has the one storyline, like Resident Evil 3: Nemesis before it.</p><p>The combat continues to confine the player to the ground when firing their weapon, and the notorious tank controls are still in effect. Players must also once again move via a series of pre-determined camera angles, though auto-aim is turned on by default, allowing players a means to note if there are enemies outside of their vision. Simultaneously pressing down and the 'run' button will have the player character perform an immediate 180 degree turn.</p><p>Code: Veronica marks the first time that the series enters into full 3D, with the environments now being made up of polygons as opposed to the pre-rendered backgrounds of old. Veronica is also much lengthier than previous games on average, to perhaps account for its single storyline.</p><p>Despite being the fourth game in the series and released after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Veronica ended up making a few steps back in terms of available mechanics and features. Nearly all of the updates brought about from Resident Evil 3 aren't apart of the game--because they were both developed at the same time causing a dissonance between the two--such as players being able to create their own ammo, live-selection choices, and the dodge maneuver. Though destructible barrels still persist and can be shot to deal a great degree of damage to any nearby enemies - including the player too if they're within range of the explosion.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770605-594_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2770605\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770605-594_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2770605\"><img alt=\"There are a couple of dual-wielding firearms available to wield in the game\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770605-594_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770605-594_02.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2770605-594_02.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770605-594_02.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>There are a couple of dual-wielding firearms available to wield in the game</figcaption></figure><p>Though what's especially notable is the fact that walking up/down staircases is once again automated and can't be performed manually. Zombies, however, can freely walk up/down staircases at will, which will also result in the player having to wait for it to make its ascent/descent before they can then use the staircase themselves.</p><p>Gore has been slightly toned down. Zombies heads no longer have the capability to explode like in previous Resident Evils, nor can their limbs fall off. When shot with a magnum, or a close-range shotgun blast to the head, the zombie's head would gush out blood but still stay intact.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p>While only featuring the one selectable story, Veronica still includes two main playable characters. For the first half of the game players take up the role of Claire Redfield, then by the second will play as her brother, Chris Redfield. Both Redfields control the exact same and there are no mechanical or statistical differences between the two.</p><p>During a short period of Chris's portion, players will temporarily return to the role of Claire. Supporting character Steve Burnside will also be controlled for an extremely brief time while he tests out his new dual submachine guns, though he too plays identical to Claire &amp; Chris.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2770604\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2770604\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770604-items7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>All characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots (to which can be eventually increased to ten), along with a ninth/eleventh slot that can equip a unique item. This can either be a lighter, to which is what Claire finds first, or a lockpick that she can attain later on in exchange for the lighter. If Claire receives the lockpick, Chris Redfield will then be able to receive the lighter for his part of the game. If she does not then Chris will gain the lockpick. Steve Birkin's unique item is a photograph of he and his parents.</p><p>The lighter can be equipped like a weapon, though while it has no means of attack it can help illuminate the area, as well as ward away any bats. It also gives Chris access to the dual submachine guns. The lockpick can be used to unlock a number of drawers and lockers for additional supplies.</p><p>All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity.</p><p>There are certain weapons that will take up two inventory slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:</p><ul><li>Calico Model 100 Dual Pistols</li></ul><ul><li>Dual Ingram Machine Pistols</li></ul><ul><li>Dual Golden Lugers</li></ul><ul><li>AK-47 Assault Rifle</li></ul><ul><li>M37 Sniper Rifle</li></ul><p>Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/item-box/3055-6126/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes</a> where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game. Items stored in the box can be collected by each of the two characters; meaning that anything left in the item box as Claire can then be collected as Chris. However to take advantage of this feature players must plan before hand as there is no actual forewarning of when players are about to switch characters.</p><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p>A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine (Green)</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution (Yellow)</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger (Red)</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison (Purple)</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p>Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.</p><p>Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/medical-herb/3055-566/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/first-aid-spray/3055-619/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p>As with Resident Evil games pre-Resident Evil 4, Code: Veronica requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.</p><p>Should the player die, the game will allow them to immediately reload their latest save from the ''Death'' screen, rather than having to head back to the main menu.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href=\"/claire-redfield/3005-628/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-628\">Claire Redfield</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/140/201132-claireredfield1_lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-201132\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.234\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/140/201132-claireredfield1_lg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-201132\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" data-width=\"518\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/140/201132-claireredfield1_lg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/140/201132-claireredfield1_lg.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/140/201132-claireredfield1_lg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/140/201132-claireredfield1_lg.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" data-width=\"518\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The initial leading protagonist, Claire is roped into another zombie infested crisis after she attempts to learn more about her brother Chris Redfield's whereabouts.

Wesker takes off to Antarctica and Chris follows. He is reunited with Claire and the two of them set out to find Steve. When they find Steve she realizes that Alexia has been experimenting on him with the T-Veronica-Virus and he has mutated into a giant reptilian monster and he tries to kill Claire. Claire runs into a prison cell but is grabbed by Alexia's tentacles, but Steve breaks through the bars and saves Claire but injures himself fatally. He reverts to human form and tells Claire that he loves her before dying.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wesker and Chris fight Alexia, but Wesker was overwhelmed by her strength and he takes off. Chris manages to defeat her, but she comes back to life after Chris activates the self destruct system, releasing all the locks in the facility freeing Claire. Chris then destroys Alexia for the final time and him and Claire run to the emergency elevator where they see Wesker and his men taking Steve's body for further experiments. Claire runs to the plane, and Chris and Wesker have another showdown until they are separated by an explosion. Wesker vows to get his revenge next time they meet and then they both run to avoid dying in more explosions. The game ends with Claire and Chris escaping and Chris vowing to take down Umbrella once and for all.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Combat Knife</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889345-recv_knife.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889345\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889345-recv_knife.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889345\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889345-recv_knife.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889345-recv_knife.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889345-recv_knife.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889345-recv_knife.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A standard survival knife that Claire finds in prison office where the game begins.

During this occasion it is completely optional to fight and can be largely ignored if the player is fast enough. The option to fight is still there, but would primarily be a waste of ammo since it doesn't reward anything minus its evacuation of the area, and will still be encountered later on as Chris Redfield.</p><h3>Gulp Worm Part II</h3><p>Once Chris Redfield arrives at Rockfort Island to save his sister Claire, unbeknownst that she's already left for Antarctica, he is ambushed by the Gulp Worm from before. After swallowing Rodrigo Juan Raval whole, Chris is forced to fight it. Its design includes a lot of surprise attacks, burrowing underground then quickly resurfacing for an attack. Sometimes it'll pop out and do a kind of roar, giving players the opportunity to attack it.</p><p>While this battle is going on, the elevator that'll take Chris up to the surface is making its slow descent; it essentially acts as the timer for the boss battle, and as such if the elevator arrives before the player kills the Gulp Worm, they can opt to avoid this battle and just use the elevator. Choosing this outcome will deprive the player of the lighter Rodrigo may give, however - if Claire gave it to him before hand that is.</p><h3>Tyrant T-103 Part I</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910130-t_103.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910130\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3943661971831\" data-width=\"284\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 284px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910130-t_103.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910130\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-width=\"284\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910130-t_103.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910130-t_103.jpg 284w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910130-t_103.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910130-t_103.jpg 284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-width=\"284\"></noscript></a></figure><p>An alternate version of the <i>Mr. X</i> Tyrant model encountered during Resident Evil 2, this model is encountered twice by Claire Redfield. It differs in appearance from its coated brethren, equipped with a large, round mallet-like right fist with a large claw--as is custom with most Tyrant models-- for its left. The first time it is encountered, the player is cornered in a narrow passage with the Tyrant impeding the players progress forward, with a raging fire blocking the rear. Should the player walk into the fire, they will die instantly, forcing the player to unload everything they have into the Tyrant as it slowly makes its advance.</p><h3>Tyrant T-103 Part II</h3><p>The Tyrant is once again fought just as Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside are attempting to escape Rockfort Island. Somehow managing to latch onto the cargo hold, the player has to weaken the Tyrant with gunfire and then attempt to knock the Tyrant out the back with a large crate released from its safety harness. The Tyrant is otherwise invincible and cannot be killed without attempting to knock it out through the back with the crate.</p><h3>Nosferatu</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910138\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.81609195402299\" data-width=\"435\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 435px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910138\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg 435w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg 435w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910138-435px_nosferatu.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Once Alexander Ashford--the man twins Alfred and Alexia were cloned from--he was experimented on with the Veronica Virus to such an extent that he became yet another addition to the B.O.W. library. Initially seen through a grated floor, tightly strapped to a chair with a huge halberd resting on him, he eventually manages to escape and is fought on a rooftop by Claire Redfield. His main source of attack is through a constant expulsion of poisonous gas that covers a huge area of effect; up close, he has a series of sharp appendages that have sprouted out of multiple areas of his body that he can attack with. Nosferatu moves slowly, though the large cast of fog that covers the battleground can make attacking him difficult.</p><p>At this point the player has access to a Sniper Rifle with 7 shots available; using the first-person view, the player can potentially kill Nosferatu with a single hit should they shoot his exposed heart well enough. Whether Claire is poisoned during this fight also factors later on in the story when Chris Redfield finds her. If she was poisoned, Chris must search for a specific antidote (blue herbs won't work) before the story can carry on.</p><h3>Albinoid Adult</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910137-355px_albinoid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910137\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"355\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 355px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910137-355px_albinoid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910137\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910137-355px_albinoid.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910137-355px_albinoid.jpg 355w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910137-355px_albinoid.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910137-355px_albinoid.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The full grown Albinoid creature Claire encountered only hours before has now fully grown into a huge amphibious lizard-like monster. Completely surfaced under a shallow pool--literally, within a swimming pool--it is the de-facto guardian of an emblem the player needs to collect. The Albinoid will periodically discharge an aura of electricity, however, making it very dangerous to enter. The Albinoid is completely harmless otherwise, as it doesn't leave the pool. The player can opt to kill it, but if timed right can also enter the pool and collect the emblem with minimal damage.</p><h3>Giant Black Widow</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910136\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.71881606765328\" data-width=\"473\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 473px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910136\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg 473w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg 473w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910136-black_widow.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>First seen under a sea of ice covering the main hall of the Umbrella Antarctica Base, Chris Redfield is forced to use a crane to crack the ice open to pull out the corpse of Nosferatu to claim his signet ring.

With a brief stint back as Claire during Chris' portion of the story, she finds him strapped to a chair with a large halberd resting on him exactly like Alexander. Just as Claire attempts to release him from the chair, Steve begins to mutate turning into a kind of green ogre. He equips the halberd with ease and begins to chase Claire. Steve isn't intended to be fought and the player can only run, as Steve can kill the player with just two hits, and a series of gates are being locked down through the hallway, forcing the player to stop for nothing.</p><h3>Alexia Ashford Humanoid Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910134-210px_alexia1_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910134\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6904761904762\" data-width=\"210\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 210px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:169.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910134-210px_alexia1_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910134\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910134-210px_alexia1_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910134-210px_alexia1_1.jpg 210w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910134-210px_alexia1_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910134-210px_alexia1_1.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Coming off of Claire's encounter with the mutated Steve, Wesker and Alexia--now completely nude and mutated into a grey-ish color--engage in a fight with Wesker only just scraping by; noticing Chris Redfield hiding nearby, he calls it onto his ''best man'' to take care of her. Alexia herself is a relatively easy battle as they go, but her attacks can do severe damage. She will walk slowly towards the player, leeching a small line of blood which quickly bursts into flames.

If the player doesn't react, shooting Alexia with literally anything, then Alexia will kill Claire causing a game over. If the player does shoot her, she will then transform into a huge blob creature with what look like dragonfly wings, but still retaining the majority of her previous mutations face. Because of Alexia's size, the player has very little room to maneuver and only has running access on a roughly 75 degree angle. Alexia herself mostly relies on her large tentacles that'll slam down on the player. She also summons a group of small pod like creatures that plant themselves and spout out a strange tail that'll whip the player. The player can kill them, (though they prove difficult because of their size) but Alexia will eventually replace them with more. In true Resident Evil fashion, a five minute timer is ticking down during this battle.</p><h3>Alexia Ashford Dragonfly Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910132\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.85748792270531\" data-width=\"414\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 414px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910132\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg 414w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg 414w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1910132-414px_insideofbhtdc__61_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Alexia Sack Form has taken enough damage, she will exit her sack and hover above the player. At the same time the Linear Launcher, which Chris and Claire prepared to power-up, is now available. Using the Linear Launcher, the player is to try and shoot down Alexia; her constant movement can make this tricky, however. Her only attack during this form is that same line of fluid she shoots out that bursts into flames. This form of Alexia isn't particularly difficult as a boss and the difficulty is built around the 5 minute timer that'll still be ticking down during this battle.</p><h2>Battle Game</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889496\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66320166320166\" data-width=\"481\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 481px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889496\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg 481w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg 481w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889496-cv_battle_008.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Battle Game is a time-trial mode that is unlocked after a single completion of the main game. Here it allows the player to choose from a select few of the main cast from Veronica X to play as and make their way through a set number of rooms. The rooms themselves are all unrelated to one another and stretch across environments throughout the entire game. Each character has their own unique load-out, though they have infinite ammo for all weapons; the main goal of the mode is to primarily get a decent time, rather than try make do with limited supplies. To pass on to the next room, however, every enemy must first be killed.</p><p>Initially, only Claire and Chris are available, though if the player finds the broken Golden Luger pistol during the main game, Steve Burnside will be unlocked from the outset. He can otherwise still be unlocked if the player completes the mode as Claire. Albert Wesker also makes his playable debut for the Battle Game, and is unlocked via a completion with Chris in the mode. The final character is an alternate costume of Claire that is also unlocked after a single completion as default Claire in the Battle Game. Claire's alternate costume is exclusive for the Battle Game mode, however, and cannot be worn through the main game. Should the player get an S ranking for all characters, they unlock a Linear Launcher with infinite ammo (the Linear Launcher is also unlockable with infinite ammo for the main-game if the player scores an S ranking).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889500\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1889500\"><img alt=\"Albert Wesker's Epilogue screen\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Albert Wesker's Epilogue screen\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/1889500-end___4_.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Albert Wesker's Epilogue screen</figcaption></figure><p>What is unique about the Battle Game is that introduces the option to play in a first person view.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Onimusha: Warlords is an action-adventure game by <a href=\"/capcom-production-studio-2/3010-1495/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1495\">Capcom Production Studio 2</a> and the first entry in the <a href=\"/onimusha/3025-467/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-467\">Onimusha</a> (2001-2006) franchise. Created and produced by <a href=\"/keiji-inafune/3040-35794/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-35794\">Keiji Inafune</a> (<a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a>, <a href=\"/lost-planet/3025-482/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-482\">Lost Planet</a>, <a href=\"/dead-rising/3025-1218/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1218\">Dead Rising</a>), directed by <a href=\"/jun-takeuchi/3040-41365/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41365\">Jun Takeuchi</a> (<a href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5</a>) and released for the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> on January 25, 2001, it was the first PS2 game to break the million unit mark, with 900,000 copies sold in the first two weeks in Japan and roughly 2.5 million in its lifetime.</p><p>In 2002, an updated edition featuring enhanced graphics, new enemies, costumes and an extra boss was released for the for the <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> as <a href=\"../../genma-onimusha/61-10990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genma Onimusha</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The game began development at the tail end of the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>'s life and borrowed the <a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil</a> engine &amp; some of its mechanics and technical quirks, such as pre-rendered backgrounds, doors-as-load-times, document collection and simple item puzzles, and the well known <a href=\"/tank-controls/3015-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls</a> in favor of analog controls. When the PlayStation 2 was announced, the team decided to rebuild the game with the new hardware in mind. While the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvOFYZ5Cm2I\" rel=\"nofollow\">PS1 version</a> was scrapped the engine's quirks and the game's RE-inspired game design remained.</p><p>The game was highly anticipated at the time of it's release; not only was Mega Man's creator at the helm, but the developers were ambitious and utilized motion capture for combat (still novel in 2001) and had a 200-piece orchestra performing the soundtrack. The 3D model of <a href=\"/hidemitsu-akechi/3005-3936/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3936\">Samanosuke</a> was based on famous Japanese actor <a href=\"/takeshi-kaneshiro/3040-41242/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41242\">Takeshi Kaneshiro</a>, and the fidelity of his and other models in the CG cutscenes were impressive at the time.</p><p>Some controversy surrounds the critically acclaimed score of the game, as it was revealed in February 2014 that <a href=\"/mamoru-samuragoch/3040-41243/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41243\">Mamoru Samuragochi</a> (credited as Samuragoch), the game's composer and a sort of \"Japanese Beethoven\" had lied about the reality of his hearing disability (barely deaf vs completely deaf). Also, he had in fact not composed the game's music at all. <a href=\"/takashi-niigaki/3040-41377/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41377\">Takashi Niigaki</a> was the ghostwriter.</p><p>The most famous trivia about the game comes from a bug report. Under certain conditions, when the player performed an uppercut slash on an enemy, it would be lifted up and frozen in mid-air, and the player could continue attacking freely until the enemy was destroyed. While this effect was excised from Warlords, it was purposely rebuilt into <a href=\"/devil-may-cry/3030-13072/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13072\">Devil May Cry</a>, and ended up being one of the defining elements of the combat.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Sengoku Japan. An age of powerful warlords battling to unite the country under a single banner.</p><p>The story begins with a twist on the well-known Battle of Okehazama in 1560, where Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto's superior numbers in a surprise attack and bolstered his reputation as one of Japan's greatest warlords. In the story of Onimusha, Nobunaga is killed by a stray arrow whilst receiving news that his enemy has been eliminated. Soon after, he rises from the grave anew, and his army marches on more powerful than ever, demons in tow. No wonder he nearly conquered the country!</p><p>One year after the events at Okehazama, strange occurrences began happening at the Inabayama Castle; disappearances of soldiers and workers vanishing without a trace. Because of the unusual events, Princess Yuki sends an SOS to her cousin, the dashing samurai <em><a href=\"/hidemitsu-akechi/3005-3936/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3936\">Samanosuke Akechi</a></em>. But he arrives too late... Yuki is missing. Luckily, Samanosuke is not alone - his ninja partner, Kaeda is with him - for suddenly the castle is under siege by demons, and the quest to save the princess is afoot.</p><p>The duo split up and Samanosuke encounters a pair of Three Eye demons making off with the princess just outside. He fends them off but is ultimately knocked unconscious with ease by the giant club-wielding demon Osric. He awakens in the oni realm, where an unknown benevolent force gives him a gauntlet with the power to absorb demons' souls. With it he can increase his abilities and channel the power of the oni.</p><blockquote><p>\"So fortune has smiled upon me this day. With the power of this gauntlet, I will destroy the demons and save the princess.\"</p><cite>Samanosuke Akechi</cite></blockquote><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h4>Movement</h4><p>Though based on the same engine as Resident Evil, Onimusha is a faster, hack and slash action game with lighter puzzle elements. The legacy of the RE engine is perhaps most felt in the digital controls.</p><p>Moving feels just like RE, with Left and Right acting as rotation buttons, and Down and Up moving the player in the cardinal directions. There is a quick 180 turn button as well.</p><h4>Combat</h4><p>Combat features a standard attack button which can be mashed for combos, a special attack button which unleashes magic, a block button and a lock-on button. While locked on, Samanosuke's movement style changes from the standards RE tank controls to a <a href=\"/lock-on/3015-416/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-416\">Z-targeting</a> inspired system. Left and Right will strafe around the enemy while Up and Down dashes closer and further away. The D-Pad will modify Samanosuke's attacks as well, such as pressing Down+Attack for a kick or finishing move, or Up+Attack for a stab or stunning slash. Regardless of the lock-on button being pressed, Samanosuke will always auto orient towards the nearest enemy if he is not being directly managed.</p><h4>Puzzles</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1056463-onimusha2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056463\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.772\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1056463-onimusha2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056463\"><img alt=\"The infamous \"Water Puzzle\" stumped many players and caused much frustration.

Most puzzles in the game take the form of symbol memorization and slide puzzles. </figcaption></figure><p>There are three basic types of puzzles in the game. Environmental puzzles, trap rooms and box puzzles. The first are standard, find-the-right-item to proceed types, such as needing a ladder to get down a cliff, or two crescent shaped pieces that fit together to form a magic key. There are a few \"Trap Rooms\" in the game where Samanosuke and Kaede must work together to proceed, such as a take-turns-pulling-levers through a booby-trapped hallway area. The rest of the puzzles are box types, such as sliding block puzzles where the player attempts to form an image or set a series of numbers, or a symbol memorization puzzle, based on collecting decoder journals.</p><h4>Leveling Up &amp; Progression</h4><p>Leveling up is not character based, but instead item based. Weapons all have their own levels, and these can be increased by spending souls on the weapon. Every successive level costs more souls. Souls in turn are acquired by killing enemies. How an enemy is killed will change how many souls its death yields. Some items, like the Magic Orbs, must be upgraded in order for the player to progress the game. This is the only progress gating used in the game. Doors act as experience level checks of sorts. For example, one door may require a level 2 Kouden Orb. If the player has not yet reached the required item level, they will need to return to previous rooms and fight the respawning enemies.</p><p>The player can select the [Enhance] command to spend souls on items from any Magic Mirror, the same place they save their game.</p><p><strong>Soul Types</strong></p><ul><li>Red Souls - Used for enhancing weapons and items.</li><li>Blue Souls - Used for restoring spent <a href=\"/mp/3015-762/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-762\">magic</a>.</li><li>Yellow Souls - Used for recovering <a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health</a>.</li></ul><h4>Switching Characters</h4><p>At various point in the game (and one lengthier section) the player will assume the role of Kaede, Samanosuke's ninja ally. She has a similar moveset with some unique abilities, such as a 180 Backflip, wherein she leaps over the enemy, turns, and attacks them from behind.</p><h4>Weapons &amp; Magic Special Attacks</h4><ul><li><strong>Normal Sword</strong> - Samanosuke's katana and the sword Samanosuke begins the game with.</li><li><strong>Bow &amp; Arrow</strong> - A standard long-range weapon.</li><li><strong>Raizan</strong> - A katana which uses the Electric Magic of the Shiden Orb.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Alex Kidd in Shinobi World is a side-scrolling platformer game with a ninja theme, with Sega transplanting their erstwhile mascot in their <a href=\"/shinobi/3025-362/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-362\">Shinobi</a> world of masked assassins. The gameplay is a <a href=\"/crossover/3015-732/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-732\">crossover</a> hybrid of <a href=\"/alex-kidd/3025-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-24\">Alex Kidd</a> and <a href=\"/shinobi/3025-362/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-362\">Shinobi</a>. In particular, it is an Alex Kidd style <a href=\"/parody/3015-2098/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2098\">parody</a> of the original <a href=\"/shinobi/3030-3482/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3482\">Shinobi</a>.</p><p>It was the final game to feature Alex Kidd in a starring role, though he would continue to appear in Sega properties in various cameo roles. The game was developed in Japan but would not be released there: Sega had ceased production of the Sega Master System console in their native land in favor of the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis). Instead, the game was localized for international audiences.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Alex Kidd was having the time of his life, spending a lovely afternoon with his girlfriend on the planet Shinobi. Suddenly the sky was covered with grey clouds and after a flash of lighting a dark figure descended. This figure then grabbed Alex Kidd's girlfriend and then disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Before Alex Kidd could figure out what happened, there was another flash of lighting. This time a White Ninja appeared before him. Alex Kidd looked up as the White Ninja spoke.</p><p>\"The wicked Dark Ninja, whom I banished ten thousand years ago, has returned. He took your girlfriend hostage, in hope of taking control of the Miracle World. I have come to give you my special Ninja Power. Use it wisely to exterminate the Dark Ninja!\"</p><p>The White Ninja threw a glowing white ball to Alex Kidd and disappeared. The ball filled Alex Kidd with an immense amount of strength and courage. With this Alex Kidd is ready to defeat the Dark Ninja and save his girlfriend.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Alex Kidd in Shinobi World's most original gameplay mechanic is the <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall-to-wall jump</a>, which it was the first known game to use. Building on the basic wall jump in the Sega Master System version of <a href=\"/rastan/3030-2442/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2442\">Rastan</a>, Alex Kidd in Shinobi allowed Alex Kidd to jump between walls, as a way of climbing up levels. It required precise timing, adding an element of challenge to the game. This mechanic would later be used in the Sega Master System version of <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3030-20745/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20745\">Ninja Gaiden</a>, <a href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\">Super Mario 64</a>, and the 3D <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3025-472/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-472\">Ninja Gaiden</a> titles, among other games.</p><h2>Reception</h2><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Aggregate scores</th></tr><tr><th>Aggregator</th><th>Score</th></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://segaretro.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Sega Retro</a></td><td><a href=\"http://segaretro.org/Alex_Kidd_in_Shinobi_World\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">85%</a> <small>(10 reviews)</small></td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Review scores</th></tr><tr><th>Publication</th><th>Score</th></tr><tr><td><a title=\"Computer and Video Games (page does not exist)\" href=\"/computer-and-video-games-magazine/3010-2618/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2618\">Computer and Video Games</a></td><td><a href=\"http://www.smspower.org/Reviews/AlexKiddInShinobiWorld-SMS-CVG-106\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">92%</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.smspower.org/Reviews/AlexKiddInShinobiWorld-SMS-CVGCompleteGuideToSega\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">90%</a></td></tr><tr><td><a title=\"Fr:Joystick (magazine) (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick_(magazine)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Joystick</a></td><td><a href=\"http://segaretro.org/Alex_Kidd_in_Shinobi_World\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">91%</a></td></tr><tr><td><a title=\"Mean Machines Sega (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Machines_Sega\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Mean Machines Sega</a></td><td><a href=\"http://www.smspower.org/Reviews/AlexKiddInShinobiWorld-SMS-MeanMachinesSegaGamesIndex\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">90%</a></td></tr><tr><td><a title=\"Sega Power (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Power\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Sega Power</a></td><td><a href=\"http://segaretro.org/Alex_Kidd_in_Shinobi_World\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">80%</a></td></tr><tr><td><a title=\"Sega Pro (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Pro\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Sega Pro</a></td><td><a href=\"http://segaretro.org/Alex_Kidd_in_Shinobi_World\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">88%</a></td></tr><tr><td><a title=\"Sega Power (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Power\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">S: The Sega Magazine</a></td><td><a href=\"http://segaretro.org/Alex_Kidd_in_Shinobi_World\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">88%</a></td></tr><tr><td>VicioJuegos</td><td><a href=\"http://www.viciojuegos.com/analisis/Alex-Kidd-in-Shinobi-World/Jugando-a-ser-ninjas/2678/8577\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">84%</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In an early preview, the <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-105/CVG105_Aug_1990#page/n91/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">August 1990 issue</a> of <a title=\"Computer &amp; Video Games (page does not exist)\" href=\"/computer-and-video-games-magazine/3010-2618/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2618\">Computer &amp; Video Games</a> magazine referred to the game as a <a href=\"/parody/3015-2098/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2098\">parody </a>of <a title=\"Shinobi (arcade game)\" href=\"/shinobi/3030-3482/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3482\">Shinobi</a>.</p><p>Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was critically acclaimed upon release, with an average aggregate score of 85% from Sega Retro, based on ten reviews. <a title=\"Computer and Video Games (page does not exist)\" href=\"/computer-and-video-games-magazine/3010-2618/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2618\">Computer and Video Games</a> magazine gave the game a score of 92% in its <a href=\"http://www.smspower.org/Reviews/AlexKiddInShinobiWorld-SMS-CVG-106\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">September 1990 issue</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Ninja Gaiden 3 is the third main entry in <a href=\"/team-ninja/3010-1764/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1764\">Team Ninja's</a> revival of the <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3025-472/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-472\">Ninja Gaiden</a> franchise. Unlike the previous console entries, which saw initial releases on the <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and were later ported to the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>, the game will be released simultaneously on both the Xbox 360 and PS3. It is the first Ninja Gaiden title produced by the studio since the departure of former Team Ninja lead <a href=\"/tomonobu-itagaki/3040-38770/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38770\">Tomonobu Itagaki</a> and is being overseen by <a href=\"/yosuke-hayashi/3040-89725/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89725\">Yosuke Hayashi</a>, who directed <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-sigma/3030-18546/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18546\">Ninja Gaiden Sigma</a> and <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/3030-25586/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25586\">Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</a>.  An upgraded version of the game, subtitled \"<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge/3030-39749/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39749\">Razor's Edge</a>,\" was eventually released for the Wii U, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 and features additions such as gameplay tweaks and online co-op.</p><p>Ninja Gaiden 3 has a large focus on consequence, and what it feels like to kill a real, living human. Due to the series' notoriety for being very difficult, an easy mode called Hero Mode will be added. Due to NG3 being much more story focused than previous entries, Team Ninja added this mode for less-skilled players to experience the story for themselves. The game will still feature tough difficulty options, however.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Once again in Ninja Gaiden 3 players take the role of superstar ninja <a href=\"/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-104\">Ryu Hayabusa</a> equipped with the legendary <a href=\"/dragon-sword/3055-447/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-447\">Dragon Sword</a>. The game is similar to previous entries in the modern reboot where he defeats enemies using various ninja weapons, where defense is a big focus in staying alive. Ninja Gaiden 3 focuses heavily on the Katana, while weapons from past Ninja Gaiden games will be made available as DLC.</p><p>Team Ninja have decided to change up the Ninja Gaiden formula with Ninja Gaiden 3. <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Events</a> make their Ninja Gaiden debut. The game seems heavily QTE focused, where QTEs appear to be used for climbing, dodging and disposing of enemies. The feel of cutting through an enemy has also been more intensified. The methods for disposing enemies by using QTEs have been labeled as \"Steel-on-Bone\" segments. There are also cinematic QTEs for defeating bosses ala <a href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-244\">God of War</a>. These on-screen button prompts will disappear over progress in the game.</p><p>Team Ninja head <a href=\"/yosuke-hayashi/3040-89725/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89725\">Yosuke Hayashi</a> said during an E3 demo that they wanted the player to feel what it was like to cut through someone, and how it felt to perform this action. He also said that the decision for things such as using Kunai knives to climb walls was to make the player feel more immersed in the game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/1894642-cd0b152a55c8fd8eb97b1d4430cf0fb0969a4005.jpg__939x529_q85_crop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894642\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56336528221512\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/1894642-cd0b152a55c8fd8eb97b1d4430cf0fb0969a4005.jpg__939x529_q85_crop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894642\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18183/1894642-cd0b152a55c8fd8eb97b1d4430cf0fb0969a4005.jpg__939x529_q85_crop.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/1894642-cd0b152a55c8fd8eb97b1d4430cf0fb0969a4005.jpg__939x529_q85_crop.jpg 939w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/1894642-cd0b152a55c8fd8eb97b1d4430cf0fb0969a4005.jpg__939x529_q85_crop.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18183/1894642-cd0b152a55c8fd8eb97b1d4430cf0fb0969a4005.jpg__939x529_q85_crop.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Save points are no longer glowing statues, but a falcon will come from the sky and land on Ryu's arm to signify a save point, as well as replenishing his health bar. This decision was also made to add immersion to the game. Ultimate Techniques return, but how they are triggered has been changed in Ninja Gaiden 3. When Ryu's infected arm glows during battle, the player can trigger an ultimate technique that brutally slays any enemy in it's path.</p><p>For the first time in the series, there are stealth segments in Ninja Gaiden 3. There will be select moments where Hayabusa is supposed to sneak up on an enemy to perform an assassination-style execution on an enemy.</p><p>Hayashi has also announced the addition of an optional \"Hero Mode\" for players who find the normal game too hard. In Hero Mode, Ryu can never truly die, as he will automatically guard or evade all incoming attacks without the user even pressing the button whenever his health drops below 30% of the maximum life gauge.</p><p>Ninja Gaiden 3 also has mercy segments, where the player will decide whether to spare unarmed, surrendering enemies or not. It is not known yet if these actions will have a significant impact on gameplay.</p><p>It has been confirmed that Ninja Gaiden 3 will have <a href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\">PlayStation Move</a> support.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Multiplayer makes its return from <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/3030-25586/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25586\">Sigma 2</a> in NG3. At TGS2011, it was revealed that Ninja Gaiden 3 will have an online component, which will have online 8-player multiplayer modes. So far, two multiplayer modes have been revealed. Clan Battle, which is Team Deathmatch and Battle Royale which is free-for-all. During battles, it is possible for the game mode to suddenly switch to surprise players. In addition to this, there will be \"ninja trials\" which are cooperative modes which can be played by 3 players.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2078739-ng3_online18nae.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2078739\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2078739-ng3_online18nae.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2078739\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2078739-ng3_online18nae.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2078739-ng3_online18nae.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/135472/2078739-ng3_online18nae.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2078739-ng3_online18nae.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Gameplay mechanics will be roughly the same as they are in single player. Players will be able to engage in the \"steel-on-bone\" finishing mechanics, however the player being attacked will be able to defend themselves from the attack. Stealth aspects such as your character turning invisible in order to get one hit kills. Ninpo (magic) is possible to pull off by filling up a gauge during battle. Ultimate Techniques from previous games will also be possible to use on your opponents. Ranged attacks, combos as well as commiting <a href=\"/hara-kiri/3015-2198/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2198\">harakiri</a> (suicide) will be apart in the online world of Ninja Gaiden 3.</p><p>Player progression is present in Ninja Gaiden 3, offering players to increase their skill, unlocking new moves, carrying more arrows, etc. New combos and abilities with weapons will be unlocked as well. Shadow Contracts are essentially challenge, where the player must complete a contract under certain conditions (kill someone with ninpo, 5 ranged kills, etc.) for a bonus.</p><p>There will be ninja customization. Players will be able to select basic options like their outfit colors, headgear, armor and kanji to represent themselves. There are over 2000 kanji to be selected.</p><p>Three multiplayer maps have been confirmed to be in the final version of Ninja Gaiden 3, with possible DLC maps in the future. These maps will have plenty of opperunties for players to climb on rooftops, hide in the shadows, and perform all sorts of rad ninja maneuvers.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2137178\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2137178\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg 750w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg 750w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18183/2137178-417194_236729016417608_163288313761679_505687_241282464_n.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In addition to competitive multiplayer, Ninja Gaiden 3 also features co-operative trial modes for both offline and online gameplay.

After fighting through a battalion of heavily-armed soldiers and even a giant tank, Ryu manages to find their leader: a powerful alchemist known as \"The Regent of the Mask.\" Ryu fights the Regent, but the Regent places a curse on Ryu which merges his legendary Dragon Sword with his own right arm, forcing him to feel the rage of the many, many people and fiends he has killed over the years. Ryu then has to stop the Regent from unleashing his evil plans on the world, while also fighting the rage that threatens to consume him from within.</p><p>New characters are confirmed in Ninja Gaiden 3.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Originally released as a trackball arcade game from <a href=\"/atari-games/3010-794/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-794\">Atari Games</a>, Marble Madness was created, designed and programmed by developer <a href=\"/mark-cerny/3040-18965/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-18965\">Mark Cerny</a>. The object is to guide a <a href=\"/marble/3055-975/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-975\">marble</a> through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>, <a href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Master System</a> and the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a>.</p><p>Marble Madness, along with <a href=\"/archon/3025-1470/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1470\">Archon</a> and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first \"killer apps\" for the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a>, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/312416-4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-312416\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/312416-4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-312416\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/431/312416-4.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/312416-4.gif 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/431/312416-4.gif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked \"GOAL\"). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.</p><p>Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.</p><p>The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no \"lives remaining\" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.</p><p>As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black \"enemy\" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.</p><h3>Races:</h3><ol><li><b>Practice Race:</b> The first course, shorter than the others.</li><li><b>Beginner Race:</b> Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.</li><li><b>Intermediate Race:</b> Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.</li><li><b>Aerial Race:</b> Featuring narrower platforms.</li><li><b>Silly Race</b>: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill. Here, the player may \"squash\" formerly lethal enemies in one section.</li><li><b>Ultimate Race:</b> Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.</li></ol>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Jackal (Special Forces Unit Jackal) was initially released in North America as Top Gunner, though the most commonly known version - the NES version - retained the title Jackal (in North America and PAL regions). Jackal is an overhead run and gun game released by Konami in 1986. Players take the role of a jeep driving soldiers on a mission to rescue their POW comrades in Vietnam.</p><p>For its console release in Japan, for the Famicom Disk System, it was renamed Final Commando: Akai Yousai (Red Fortress). The FDS disks had considerably less space than modern NES carts at the time, and is one of the few instances where content was removed from the Japanese version of a NES game rather than the more common inverse.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>\"Your brothers-in-arms are hostages behind enemy lines, and you're their only hope for freedom. But the firepower you'll face to rescue them is awesome. Rescue the POWs in the buildings. You'll need a pocket full of miracles, and the ferocity of a wild <strong>JACKAL</strong>.\"</p><p>These opening lines from the game sum up the gist of the story. In the game, players take the role of Col. Deckar (driver) and Lt. Bob (gunner) in single player mode, and Cpl. Grey and Sgt. Quint are added in cooperative two-player mode.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In Jackal, players traverse through six levels on their armed jeep. The aim of each level is to rescue POWs from buildings in the stage and transport them to transport helicopters. After each successful drop-off, players fight a variety of bosses. Points are awarded based on performance (by both enemy kills and POW pickups), eventually rewarding the players extra lives. If the player rescues enough prisoners, weapon upgrades are rewarded, in addition special flashing prisoners award these power ups.</p><p>The player controlled jeeps feature a primary and a secondary attack. The primary weapons in the game are grenades (upgradable 4 times). The grenades first upgrade to a \"rocket launcher\", then an enhanced ranged rocket launcher, then a shrapnel-producing rocket launcher (area of damage) and lastly an enhanced area of damage rocket launcher. As a secondary weapon, the jeep features a machine gun which can only be fired upward. The machine gun lacks the power of the explosive weapons (and can not be used to rescue POWs from buildings) but can be used as a minor complementary weapon while dodging enemy attacks.</p>",

Holding up on the d-pad and pressing the B button causes the player character to use an equipped sub-weapon or spell (known in the North American version's manual as \"Warakiya War Items\"), which consumes the <a href=\"/jewel/3055-1737/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1737\">jewel</a> meter (replenished by finding <a href=\"/heart/3055-142/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-142\">heart</a>-shaped jewels throughout the game).</p><p>Along with heart-shaped jewels, sub-weapons and money bags, players can find unique power-ups and items which aid them on Trevor's quest. Meat can sometimes be found hidden throughout the land, replenishing the player's life gauge. Special power-up multiplier blocks (marked with the roman numerals II and III) increase the amount of projectiles used by sub-weapons (Trevor and Grant only). Special whip power-ups (shown as a dagger surrounded by a whip) increase the power and range of Trevor's whip (while increasing the power of Alucard's fireballs). Invisibility <a href=\"/potion/3055-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-79\">potions</a> are rare and make the player <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporarily invulnerable</a>. Rosaries are also rare and eliminate all the enemies on the screen. A special <a href=\"/1-up/3055-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-77\">1UP</a> item grants the player an extra life. Players can also be granted extra lives by achieving 20,000 points for the first life and 50,000 points for each life after.</p><h3>Crossroads</h3><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/970486-14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-970486\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/970486-14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-970486\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/970486-14.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/970486-14.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/970486-14.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/970486-14.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While the original <a href=\"/castlevania/3030-6673/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6673\">Castlevania</a> was completely linear, Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse combines it with the free-roaming exploration approach of <a href=\"/castlevania-ii-simons-quest/3030-11820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\">Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a> to make the player's path non-linear. At certain points in the game, the player is presented with a choice between two paths. All paths lead the player closer to Dracula's castle, with the exception of the clock tower path in the first crossroad (in which the bridge to the castle collapses, forcing Trevor to backtrack down the clock tower and take the alternate path). There are three crossroads and six possible paths:</p><ul><li><b>After Stage 1 -</b> The player may choose to go through the clock tower to confront Dracula's castle headfirst (stage 2) or through the forest to find a more discrete path (stage 3). However, if the player does go through the clock tower, the bridge to the castle collapses, forcing the player to backtrack down the tower and take the other path. (Though he would be able to recruit Grant up at the top of the tower and skip the very first part of stage 3)</li><li><b>During Stage 3 -</b> The major crossroad of the game, as stages 4 through 7 are determined by which path the player takes. Players can either take a haunted <a href=\"/pirate-ship/3055-523/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-523\">pirate ship</a> across the water to the guard tower (while rescuing Sypha along the way) or go deeper through the swamps and caverns to find an underground path (while recruiting Alucard along the way). The sub-stages for the Alucard path is shown numerically (starting with \"01\") while the sub-stages for the Sypha path is shown alphabetically (starting with \"0A\").</li><li><b>After Stage 5 (Alucard path only) -</b> The player chooses whether to go through an underground dungeon or a flooded temple for stage 6, prior to climbing the cliffs below the castle.</li></ul><h2>Character Abilities</h2><p>Along the way, Trevor can recruit one of three companions at a time. Once he has a companion, he can freely switch between them (a concept unused until <a href=\"/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow/3030-11321/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11321\">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>) by pressing the Select button. If Trevor encounters another companion, the player must choose which one would join him. Players can also input secret names in the Name Input Screen to begin the game with one of the companions (however, Trevor will be unable to switch to another companion later in the game).</p><h3><a href=\"/trevor-belmont/3005-33/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-33\"><b>Trevor Belmont</b></a></h3><figure style=\"width: 403px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1760801-trevor_jpmanual.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1760801\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7394540942928\" data-width=\"403\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1760801-trevor_jpmanual.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1760801\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-width=\"403\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1760801-trevor_jpmanual.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1760801-trevor_jpmanual.png 403w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1760801-trevor_jpmanual.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1760801-trevor_jpmanual.png 403w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" data-width=\"403\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Trevor plays exactly like <a href=\"/simon-belmont/3005-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-86\">Simon Belmont</a> in the previous Castlevania games.

The player takes control of Richter through seven stages full of obstacles and enemies, using his whip to take on any foes. He can extend his whip a bit by pressing forward twice during the whip animation. The player can increase their score by defeating enemies, and collecting bags of money dropped by enemies, or found when destroying candelabras, torches, and lamps. Players will also find hearts hidden in these light sources, which are used when attacking with a sub-weapon. There are many sub-weapons in the game, such as old favorites like the holy water and dagger. Players will be able to, for the first time in the series, use a super attack or \"item crash\" based on the currently held sub-weapon, which will do great damage to all foes on screen, using up a large number of hearts. In addition, Richter has a whip based item crash, which will make him jump forward with a large, burning whip, under special circumstances when he has no sub-weapon. Richter also has a special dodge ability, a jump backwards, away from harm when the player double taps the jump button. Players can also pick up a rosary, which destroys all enemies on screen.</p><p>Similar to its predecessor Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, Rondo of Blood progresses in a linear fashion, but features many branching paths through each level. Many levels feature alternate paths, secret rooms, and every level features an alternative boss battle, each stage featuring two. The game even features a few alternate stages depending on which route Richter takes on a specific stage. There is one alternate stage for each stage in the normal route, though the alternate stages are all accessed in different ways, and some must come after other alternate stages. Most secret passages will hold items useful for Richter, but a few secret rooms are the holding places for maidens Richter must rescue. The four maidens waiting to be rescued are Anette Renard, Maria Renard, Iris, and Tera. Only two of these maidens are really important two the game, those two being the Renard sisters, Maria and Anette. Once Maria is rescued from behind a hidden, locked door on the second stage in the game, she will become a playable character, and plays completely differently than Richter.</p><h3>Gameplay (Maria Renard)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-972941\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6984375\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-972941\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/972941-r47.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Maria Renard becomes a playable character in Rondo of Blood when she is rescued from Dracula's minions. Maria calls forth her animal friends to aid her in her vampire hunting. Her primary weapons are small white doves, which she can fire two at a time. The doves will fly out to about the length that Richter's whip reaches, and then come back. The birds will do damage flying out, as well as returning. In addition, Maria can use her doves while moving. Maria can also double jump, giving her more control in the air than Richter. Maria has the ability to slide as well, by pressing the jump button whilst ducking.Maria is also more fragile than Richter, having less life than him, and taking more damage from enemy attacks. Maria will be knocked back further whenever she takes damage from her foes' attacks. On the other hand, she is faster than Richter, and her size makes it easier for her to avoid attacks.</p><p>Maria also has a secret special attack, where her alternate self will come out and do great damage to anything it touches. When Maria gets a game over, she has a special screen. The words \"game over\" will fall normally, but will be in bright colors, and assorted positions. The continue screen is bordered with flowers rather than skulls.</p><h3>Richter's sub-weapons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242889\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87428571428571\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242889\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 350w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 350w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6494/242889-863.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p><b>Richter in action</b></p><p><b>Dagger:</b> The weakest of all sub-weapons, yet very fast, and costs a single heart.

These are Xuanwu the black turtle of the north, Zhuque the red bird of the south, Qinglong the blue dragon of the east, and Baihu the white tiger of the west. These bests, colors, and directions are also relevant to Japanese feng shui practice.</p><p><b>Canary</b>: Maria will release two little Canaries who will fly in a V shape around Maria.

The gameplay and story remain the same from the original, though the levels were remade, removed, and rearranged. The prologue level, along with most of the alternate levels, were removed, making the game more like the original Castlevania than the rest of the series. There are only alternate stages for stage 4 and stage 5, now. In addition, the game removed many alternate pathways and bosses, and there are no longer two bosses per stage. All of the boss fights were changed as well, as well as the hiding places for Maria and Anette. Iris and Tera are no longer in the game, and cannot be rescued, and Maria is no longer a playable character. Dracula X also removed the saving function, replacing it with a more traditional password system. Finally, the music was remixed into MIDI, as the cartridge format of the Super Nintendo lacked the storage capacity afforded by the PC Engine's CD-ROM, which utilized Redbook CD audio tracks.</p><h3>Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406060\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406060\"><img alt=\"There is no Japanese in the PSP port\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"There is no Japanese in the PSP port\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14912/406060-mednafen_2006_03_18_19_29_42_76.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There is no Japanese in the PSP port</figcaption></figure><p>The PSP remake of Rondo of Blood remains largely unchanged from the original game. Very few gameplay alterations were made, aside from two new barriers placed in stages as obstacles guarding unlockables featured only in the remake. These unlockables include music, artwork, and even the original Rondo of Blood. Each of the puzzles to save Iris and Anette were also rearranged. The player is also punished if they do not rescue Anette, who will be changed into a vampire who fights Richter if he does not save her. This boss fight replaces the fight against Shaft's ghost at the end of stage 7. Stage 5' was changed, and given a new boss. Dracula also has a new, more powerful third form.</p><p>All of the cutscenes were redone, as have the dialogue and voice acting. The German intro remains the same, played over a new FMV intro movie. Many sounds have been changed, and all of the music has been remixed from the original. Stage 5' features a completely new song to the game, and stage 7 borrows the song \"MoonFight\" from Castlevania Chronicles.</p><p>In the port of the original game, the only changes are the name \"Rondo of Blood\" at the title, and the English dubs for each of the cutscenes. All of the text is changed to English, and is the same as the names of the remake.</p><h2>Easter Eggs</h2><p>On the seventh stage, a particular mirror will show Richter's skeleton!</p><p>The first level will take Richter through the burning remains of his hometown.

After originally being announced for WiiWare as one of the original release platforms and then canceled due to file size limitations, it at last received a Nintendo-release on <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> ported by <a href=\"/blitworks/3010-9146/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-9146\">BlitWorks</a> in early 2016.</p><p>It follows the titular <a href=\"../../meat-boy/94-10939/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meat Boy</a>, a \"boy without skin,\" as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend <a href=\"../../bandage-girl/94-10940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bandage Girl</a> from the menacing <a href=\"../../dr-fetus/94-15922/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Fetus</a> while avoiding a variety of deadly obstacles (most commonly <a href=\"/saw-blade/3055-502/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-502\">sawblades</a>, <a href=\"/missile/3055-74/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-74\">missiles</a>, and <a href=\"/laser/3055-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-140\">laser beams</a>). The game is known for its tricky <a href=\"/masocore/3015-1165/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1165\">\"trial and error\" gameplay</a>, where players must use precise controls and an infinite amount of lives (with quick restarts) to clear each short level (filled with platforming puzzles of increasing difficulty) as fast as they can.</p><p>Like <a href=\"../../alien-hominid/61-17452/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alien Hominid</a>, the concept for Super Meat Boy began as a <a href=\"/flash-game-origin/3015-6521/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6521\">free online game made in Adobe Flash</a> for <a href=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newgrounds</a>.

Super Meat Boy references other games and videos from the Newgrounds community, as well as the indie game scene at large (including <a href=\"../../n/61-13373/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N</a>, <a href=\"/aquaria/3030-6630/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6630\">Aquaria</a>, <a href=\"/vvvvvv/3030-29745/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29745\">VVVVVV</a>, <a href=\"../../i-wanna-be-the-guy/61-22845/\" rel=\"nofollow\">I Wanna Be The Guy</a>, and <a href=\"/braid/3030-20716/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20716\">Braid</a>).

The PSN version, released near the game's fifth anniversary (and originally free for <a href=\"/playstation-plus/3015-5817/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5817\">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers), features a brand new soundtrack (due to <a href=\"/danny-baranowsky/3040-99995/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99995\">the original composer</a> declining a new licensing deal) featuring Ridiculon (of <a href=\"/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth/3030-40865/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40865\">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> fame), David Scatliffe (of <a href=\"/hotline-miami/3030-39452/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39452\">Hotline Miami</a> fame), and <a href=\"/laura-shigihara/3040-97575/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97575\">Laura Shigihara</a> (of <a href=\"/plants-vs-zombies/3030-25709/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25709\">Plants vs. Zombies</a> fame).</p><p><a href=\"/digital-rights-management/3015-1704/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1704\">DRM</a>-free versions for the PC, Mac, and Linux were also released through the <a href=\"/humble-bundle/3015-6612/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6612\">Humble Store</a> (also including keys for the Steam version).

Navigation of these obstacles requires extremely precise timing to pass. Failure means instant death and a quick restart from the beginning of the level. The player is given an infinite amount of lives and near-instantaneous respawns, but Meat Boy leaves a trail of blood to mark where he has been and what obstacles previously killed him. When a regular level is completed, a <a href=\"/instant-replay/3015-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-45\">replay</a> showcases every attempt within the level simultaneously.</p><p>Characters have two abilities at their disposal: a <a href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jump</a> button and an ability button. For Meat Boy (and most other characters), pressing the ability button engages sprinting. Some characters sprint automatically and replace the ability button with another power, such as <a href=\"/tim/3005-5730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5730\">Tim's</a> ability to rewind time or <a href=\"/viridian/3005-16930/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16930\">Viridian's</a> ability to inverse his own personal gravity. To keep the difficulty in check, the game features extremely precise controls. Quickly tapping the jump button performs a small hop, while holding down the jump button performs a tall leap. Players can also stick to the wall (which may either slow their descent or slightly continue their ascent) and press the jump button again for a <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a>. Some unlockable characters have special jumping abilities, such as <a href=\"/the-kid/3005-16987/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16987\">the Kid's</a> ability to double jump and <a href=\"/jill/3005-16969/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16969\">Jill's</a> ability to stall her descent.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283745\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283745\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Over the course of the game, new mechanics are introduced and obstacles become more complex. These include rising tides of lava, portals, magnetic fields, fans, lava rocks, and eventually enemies that hunt down the player character. All obstacles will result in instantaneous death upon contact. The \"<a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>\" are equally indestructible; instead of actually fighting them, these levels require players to navigate difficult puzzles under time restraints until a <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene</a> is triggered.</p><p>Players can also collect bandages scattered around certain levels to unlock characters and certain levels. In order for the player to keep Bandages, they must collect them and successfully reach the exit in one attempt. Some bandages require specific characters and all are difficult to collect, especially in the purple Warp Zones, where players must not only collect the Bandage, but clear each of the three levels with a limited number of lives.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Super Meat Boy features five main worlds, each with forty regular levels. The initial twenty levels are referred to as the \"Light World\". If the player is able to clear a Light World level under its par time, they will be able to access the \"Dark World\" counterpart (which shares the same basic geometry, but has a different appearance and increased difficulty). Each Light World version of the five main worlds also include a boss level, which must be completed in order to progress to the next world. Boss levels are unlocked after the player beats 17 out of the 20 Light World levels.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406229\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406229\"><img alt=\"Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. \" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. </figcaption></figure><p>Along the way, players can also find purple <a href=\"/warp-zone/3015-804/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-804\">Warp Zones</a> within certain levels. These portals vanish after a set period of time during the level attempt, though reaching these portals makes the Warp Zone available in the level selection screen. Entering a Warp Zone will transport Meat Boy (regardless of which character reaches the warp zone) to a retro-themed zone which is notably difficult. Each zone comes with three levels that must be completed consecutively with a special version of Meat Boy. Bandages are found within these warp zones, but the player will only have three attempts per level to collect them and clear the Warp Zone. If Meat Boy dies during the final attempt at any level, all bandages found during the Warp Zone attempt will be reset, and the player will be kicked back to the level selection screen. Replays and par times are unavailable for Warp Zones.</p><p>Red Warp Zones function similarly to purple Warp Zones but are played instead with a secret character. There are no bandages in red warp zones but there are also unlimited lives. There are only five red warp zones, one in each of the main Light Worlds. Each main world also has a special \"<a href=\"/glitch/3015-511/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-511\">glitch</a> zone\", reached by getting to Bandage Girl while she is in a randomly occurring \"glitch state\". Glitch zones feature no bandages and only one level, which is typically longer and more difficult than any of the world's Warp Zones.</p><h3>Chapter 1: The Forest</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../street-fighter-ii/61-243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Lil' Slugger (giant walking chainsaw driven by Dr. Fetus)</p><p>The Forest introduces buzzsaws, static sawblade launchers, and impassable tiles that crumble away soon after the player touches it.</p><h3>Chapter 2: The Hospital</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../castlevania/61-6673/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Castlevania</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/chad/3005-15923/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15923\">C.H.A.D.</a> (mutated living abomination of blood and tissue)</p><p>The Hospital introduces fans, crawling slimes that stick to surfaces, floating enemies that bounce around aimlessly, piles of deadly needles, keys that unlock certain tiles, and timed laser beams.</p><h3>Chapter 3: The Salt Factory</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../the-adventures-of-lolo/61-5026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Adventures of Lolo</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/brownie/3005-17017/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17017\">Brownie</a></p><p>The Salt Factory introduces harmful salt, homing missile launchers, moving platforms, tiles that only crumble away after coming in to contact with a missile, and high-speed conveyor belts.</p><h3>Chapter 4: Hell</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../ninja-gaiden/61-1653/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ninja Gaiden</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/little-horn/3005-17018/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17018\">Little Horn</a> (monster made of Meat Boy corpses)</p><p>Hell introduces lava pits (that sometimes rise), moving lava rocks, portals, rotating eyes that slowly lock on to the player while shooting laser beams, and demon homing missiles that split in to separate small missiles on impact.</p><h3>Chapter 5: Rapture</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../mega-man-2/61-14026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mega Man 2</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Larrie's Lament (a group of enormous carnivorous worms)</p><p>Rapture introduces orbs that repulse the player, abominations (both running and flying) that head towards the player, and homing sawblade launchers.</p><h3>Chapter 6: The End</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3966\">Pokémon Red/Blue</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/dr-fetus/3005-15922/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15922\">Dr. Fetus</a></p><p>Unlocked after completing Chapter 5, The End includes five regular levels (with both Light World and Dark World variations) that can only be played by Meat Boy and are designed to test the player's mastery of previous concepts.

There are <a href=\"/\">no jump</a> <a href=\"/\">buttons</a> (standard in most platformers) present. In order for the player to progress through the game, he must complete puzzles by moving around and using the flip button at the right time while avoiding obstacles (primarily <a href=\"/spikes/3055-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-183\">spikes</a>). The game's increasing <a href=\"/difficulty-level/3015-183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-183\">difficulty</a>, made slightly easier by numerous <a href=\"/checkpoints/3015-292/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-292\">checkpoints</a> scattered around the levels, remains a consistent challenge, but never to the level of the deliberately unfair games in the so-called <a href=\"/masocore/3015-1165/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1165\">\"masocore\"</a> sub-genre.</p><p>The game includes several main areas, four of which can be accessed in any order. These main areas are separated by vast space, which must be explored in a <a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">Metroidvania</a> style. (Though teleporters scattered around the dimension can make progression faster) The cameras in most screens are static, only changing when the player enters a new area from any direction. This can increase difficulty, as the player leaps blindly into another screen, only to get hit by spikes. (As an example, a screen titled \"What Lies Below?\" is above a screen titled \"Spikes Do!\")</p><h3>Extras and Unlocks</h3><p>While the player progresses through the game, he encounters special \"shiny trinkets\" (20 in all), which can be collected to unlock music and game modes. Game modes can also be unlocked by completing the game or doing well in other game modes.</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"/time-trials/3015-1361/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1361\">Time Trials</a> Mode</b> <i>(unlocked by progressing through the game and finding trinkets)</i> - Players start at the beginning of the chosen level and must beat the level as fast as they can while collecting trinkets and trying not to die. The player is judged based on the following: they beat the level's par time, if they collect all the level's trinkets, and if they didn't die. Failing all objectives earns a B-rank, completing one objective earns an A-rank, completing two objectives in one run earns a S-rank, and completing all three objectives in one run earns a V-rank.</li></ul><ol><li>Space Station 1 <i>(rescue</i> <i>Violet</i> and find 3 trinkets)</li><li>The Laboratory <i>(rescue</i> <i>Victoria</i> and find 6 trinkets)</li><li>The Tower <i>(rescue</i> <i>Vermilion</i> and find 9 trinkets)</li><li>Space Station 2 <i>(rescue</i> <i>Vitellary</i> and find 12 trinkets)</li><li>The Warp Zone <i>(rescue</i> <i>Verdigris</i> and find 15 trinkets)</li><li>The Final Level <i>(complete the game and find 18 trinkets)</i></li></ol><ul><li><b>Intermission Mode</b> <i>(unlocked by completing both intermission levels)</i> - Play through the two intermission levels (when the player finds the first and third crew member) with any of the characters.</li><li><b>No Death Mode</b> <i>(unlocked by achieving a S-rank or above in four of the six time trial levels)</i> - Go through the entire game (with or without cutscenes) with no checkpoints. One death means <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">game over</a>.</li><li><b>Flip Mode</b> <i>(unlocked by completing the game)</i> - Enabling this option flips the dimension vertically, making it feel like a brand new dimension! Can be enabled alongside the other extra game modes.</li><li><b>Ship Jukebox</b> <i>(unlocked by finding trinkets)</i> - Find trinkets to unlock music to play at the ship.</li></ul><h3>Secret Lab</h3><p>After collecting all trinkets and then talking to <a href=\"/victoria/3005-16942/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16942\">Victoria</a>, a humorous cutscene plays. The trinket room is blown apart and, in place of the trinkets, a huge teleporter stands in the middle of the room leading to a secret laboratory. (Which can be accessed through the mode selection menu). Inside is a <a href=\"/trophy/3055-1318/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1318\">trophy</a> room (that shows off the player's <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements</a>) and Super Gravitron, a special mini-game similar to the one found in the second intermission level (only endless and much more difficult).</p><p>There are 19 trophies to collect, including beating the game with Flip Mode or No Death Mode enabled, clearing the game under a certain number of deaths, surviving a certain amount of time in Super Gravitron, and earning V-ranks on each time trial levels.</p><h2>Soundtracks</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248477\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87015945330296\" data-width=\"439\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 439px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1248477\"><img alt=\"PPPPPP Cover Art\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg 439w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"PPPPPP Cover Art\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg 439w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39474/1248477-pppppplain_view.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>PPPPPP Cover Art</figcaption></figure><p>Released in January 2010, the VVVVVV soundtrack, entitled PPPPPP, was composed by <a href=\"/magnus-palsson/3040-100846/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100846\">Magnus \"SoulEye\" Pålsson</a>.

Star Tropics is an anomaly in that the game was developed exclusively for American and European audiences, and has never seen the light of day in Japan. The game was developed by a team of Japanese game designers living in the U.S., the same team responsible for the <a href=\"/mike-tysons-punch-out/3030-4848/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4848\">Punch-Out!! </a>games. The game has been re-released on the <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Wii virtual console </a>for both North American and PAL regions as of January 2008.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>StarTropics tells the story of <a href=\"/mike-jones/3005-11429/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11429\">Mike Jones </a>, a teenager and all-star pitcher from the mainland U.S., arrives on C-Island to visit his archaeologist uncle, Dr. Steve Jones. Upon his arrival, he finds that his uncle has gone missing, and absolutely no one knows where he went. Mike, determined to discover the whereabouts of his beloved uncle, arms himself with baseball parephernelia, and sets off on his quest. He'll battle a giant octopus, cure diseases, fight zombies and moai heads, on his long and perilous journey.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393248\"><img alt=\"The overworld. \" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The overworld. </figcaption></figure><p>StarTropics is a mix of console RPG and action-adventure elements. Outside of dungeon areas, the player moves around the <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld </a>map and villages, talks to others, collects items and solves the occasional puzzle. Inside dungeons, the viewpoint switches to a zoomed in top-down perspective. The player must guide Mike from room to room, jumping over traps and gaps, trigger switches, and fight off enemies using an assortment of weapons ranging from the basic yo-yo to an alien laser gun and a magic snow man doll capable of freezing enemies.</p><p><a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\"> Health </a>is monitored in an identical fashion to the <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda </a>series, with a display of hearts that empties as Mike takes damage. The life meter can be extended by finding heart containers scattered throughout the game.</p><h2>The Secret Password</h2><p>When StarTropics was released on the NES, the game was packaged with a letter from Mike's uncle. Although it looked like a fairly standard if useless game trinket, information hidden within the paper was actually required to complete the game. There comes a point in the game where Mike is stranded on an island, and in order to get the Sub-C back on course, he must enter a three digit <a href=\"/password/3015-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-38\">password</a>. The player is given a hint to apply water to the letter in order to reveal the code required to continue. In an era before the internet and online FAQs, if the player either did not understand that the game referred to the letter that came with the game or had lost the letter entirely, then they would not be able to progress any further into the game without guessing the correct passcode: 747.</p><p>When StarTropics was released on the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>, Nintendo got around this <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzle </a>by including the letter from Dr. Jones in the game's Home Menu operations guide. By clicking an icon in the letter that depicted a sheet of paper being dipped in water, the password is revealed.</p>",

For Kirby, each ally gives him bonus maneuverability on certain environments (ground for Rick, air for Coo, and water for Kine), allows him to inhale at places where he couldn't (in the air for Coo, in the water for Kine), and alters his abilities (for example, using Spark while riding Rick changes it to the Beam attack from Kirby's Adventure).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Set in <a href=\"/dream-land/3035-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-340\">Dream Land</a>, the story involves a mysterious and evil force called <a href=\"/dark-matter/3005-9934/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9934\">Dark Matter</a>, who has possessed <a href=\"/king-dedede/3005-1301/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1301\">King Dedede</a> and has destroyed the Rainbow Bridges (connecting the seven Rainbow Islands) with the intent of conquering Dream Land.

The enhanced color palette support is also used when played with the <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a>. Initially, an enhanced color re-release of the game was planned for the Game Boy Color (akin to <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-dx/3030-8881/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8881\">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX</a>), but was cancelled.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game was later digitally re-released for the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> (via <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>) on February 15, 2012 (in Japan), May 17, 2012 (in Europe), and August 1, 2013 (in North America) and was included in the <a href=\"/kirbys-dream-collection-special-edition/3030-38070/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38070\">Kirby's Dream Collection</a> compilation for the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The gameplay of Kirby's Dream Land 2 expands on that of the original <a href=\"/kirbys-dream-land/3030-19788/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19788\">Kirby's Dream Land</a>, as well as <a href=\"/kirbys-adventure/3030-15890/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15890\">Kirby's Adventure</a>. For the most part, the game is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. The goal in each level is to reach the final door, by traversing throughout a (sometimes mazelike) level, defeating enemies, gathering items, and dodging obstacles.</p><figure style=\"width: 477px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/510223-ss_08.06.2008_10.33.48am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-510223\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.90146750524109\" data-width=\"477\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/510223-ss_08.06.2008_10.33.48am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-510223\"><img alt=\" Kirby must collect the seven Rainbow Drops to save Dram Land.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3693/510223-ss_08.06.2008_10.33.48am.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/510223-ss_08.06.2008_10.33.48am.jpg 477w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3693/510223-ss_08.06.2008_10.33.48am.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Kirby must collect the seven Rainbow Drops to save Dram Land.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kirby has six health points. Each hit takes away one of these points, which can be replenished by picking up a variety of items, such as the well-known<a href=\"/maxim-tomato/3055-391/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-391\"> Maxim Tomato</a>. Kirby's other abilities include an indefinite jump (by inhaling air and flying upward), exhalation as an attack (even when Kirby doesn't posses an enemy's ability), as well as swimming and regular jumping.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The key new feature of Kirby's Dream Land 2 is the addition of several animal friends to assist Kirby. There are three allies in Dream Land 2: <a href=\"/rick/3005-9917/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9917\">Rick the Hamster</a>, <a href=\"/kine/3005-9920/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9920\">Kine the Ocean Sunfish</a>, and <a href=\"/coo/3005-9919/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9919\">Coo the Owl</a>. Each specializes in a different mode of travel, which are (respectively) ground, sea, and air. Kirby is still able to use enemy's abilities while riding these creatures, but they may sometimes be modified. It also gives Kirby higher power in terms of speed, attack, and health points.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There is a total of seven separate worlds Kirby must travel through.</p><ul><li>Level 1 - Grass Land</li><li>Level 2 - Big Forest</li><li>Level 3 - Ripple Field</li><li>Level 4 - Iceberg</li><li>Level 5 - Red Canyon</li><li>Level 6 - Cloudy Park</li><li>Level 7 - Dark Castle</li></ul><h3>Rainbow Drops</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">To achieve the true ending and face a final confrontation with the <a href=\"/dark-matter/3005-9934/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9934\">Dark Matter</a>, Kirby must locate seven Rainbow Drops (each located on their own Rainbow Island), which then forms into a Rainbow Sword.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Kirby: Planet Robobot is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo. It marks the 15<sup>th</sup> main installment in the Kirby franchise, releasing on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016.</p><p>Along a vibrant and dynamic 2.5D environment, Kirby floats, slide attacks, inhales, and star spits his way to the golden exit door at the end of each stage. This time around, the pink puffball from Dreamland has a new toy: Robobot Armor. After defeating an Invader Armor mid-boss, or hopping into a vacant suit mid-stage, Kirby plows through his enemies with greater ease utilizing Robobot versions of familiar copy abilities. Often times, the Robobot allows Kirby to solve simple puzzles, or reach secret areas, with important collectables as his reward. Code Cubes are the key to facing the boss in each of the 6 main zones in this techno world, but Kirby can also nab a variety of stickers to slap onto his Robobot between stages.</p><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Napping beneath a tree on the colorful Planet Popstar, Kirby wakes to the sight of extraterrestrial robot invaders from the Haltmann Works Company. Their goal is to harvest resources from the planet. King Dedede’s castle cannons and Meta Knight’s Halberd are no match for the weaponry of the giant spacecraft. It’s once again up to Kirby to save his planet.</p><p>After making his way through the greenery of the Patched Plains, the bustling town of Resolution Road, and the docks of OverloadOcean, Kirby meets Susie, the secretary of the Haltmann Works Company. Failing to defeat the pink puffpall with her mech suit, she reveals plan B. Kirby’s rival, Meta Knight, has been captured and mechanized. Acting as Susie’s new personal security guard, Meta Knight attacks, but is defeated, collapsing into a deep ravine before the Haltmann Works Company’s control can be lifted.</p><p>Soon finding himself in the sleepy city of Rhythm Route, Kirby once again runs into Susie who is surprised by his persistence. This time, she deploys a clone of King Dedede who is soundly defeated.</p><p>Now that the final area supplying the company with power has been shut down, Kirby breaches the mothership to face the powerful defenses of its headquarters, the Access Ark. At the heart of the ark lies the office of President Haltmann himself where Susie again sends a newly upgraded Mecha Knight+ against the pink hero. After his second defeat, Mecha Knight is freed from the company’s control and President Haltmann chooses to reveal himself. He expresses his disappointment with Susie’s performance and dismisses her before revealing that he has reactivated a powerful wish-granting computer named Star Dream. Using a mech suit of his own, President Haltmann engages Kirby in battle similar to that of Susie’s. Haltmann and his suit are bested. Enraged by the “Savages” of Planet Popstar, the greedy President dons a special helmet to take control of the Star Dream. Suddenly, he is betrayed by Susie who forcefully removes the helmet, revealing her plan to sell the wish-granting machine to the highest bidder.</p><p>The Star Dream intervenes, shooting down Susie and possessing President Haltmann, speaking through him. It has been studying the cosmos through the Haltmann Works Company and has found all organic life forms a nuisance. It intends to wipe all life from the universe.</p><p>The Star Dream blasts off into space. Kirby enters a Robobot given to him by Susie who has put her selfishness aside. On his way to confront the massive machine, Kirby encounters Meta Knight one last time who is ready to unite against a common enemy. Fusing with Meta Knight’s Halberd, Kirby becomes the pilot of a giant pink ship ready for a fight.</p><p>After a long battle, Kirby and his Robobot are ejected from a defeated Halberd to finish the confrontation. Kirby loses consciousness, but is saved by his Robobot which tosses him towards Popstar and sheds a tear at the loss of his new organic friend.</p><p>Kirby wakes back on Popstar. The mechanization of his planet has been undone. Friends and enemies rejoice together with the exception of proud Meta Knight aboard his Halberd…</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like most games in the series, gameplay focuses on copying enemy abilities to traverse platforms, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. Stages generally focus on expanding the mechanics of a couple specific abilities available to Kirby within the stage and are punctuated by puzzles securing Code Cubes or Stickers.</p><p> </p><h2>Sales</h2><p>The game sold 1.08m copies worldwide as of September 30, 2016.</p>",

A new and mysterious <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/computer-virus/3015-7690/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7690\">virus</a>, known as \"Nightmare\", is turning Reploids into crazed Mavericks. When Reploid scientist <a href=\"/isoc/3005-28909/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28909\">Isoc</a> (along with his subordinate, <a href=\"/high-max/3005-28910/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28910\">High Max</a>) identify the cause as the \"ghost\" of Zero, X (now brandishing Zero's Z-Saber) must investigate the Nightmare phenomenon (while encountering infected researchers of the virus, who were created by lead researcher <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gate/3005-23623/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23623\">Gate</a>) and stop Zero's Nightmare doppelganger.</p><p>The game was later released for the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in different parts of Asia sometime in 2002-2003 and is included in the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-x-collection/3030-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1483\">Mega Man X Collection</a> compilation for the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> (released on January 10, 2006).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game starts off with X, but Zero can be unlocked later. The game features a \"Nightmare\" system, which makes it so that when X or Zero defeats a Maverick, their icon on the level select screen will become red, which means that certain environmental hazards will be added to the level to increase difficulty. This is important because this game has many more hidden secrets to find than the other games in the X series.</p><h2>Ranking System</h2><p>Mega Man X6 offers a leveling system, and the way a character can level up is by obtaining souls from certain Mavericks. Once the player collects enough, the character's ranking will go up, which allows the characters to have access others special parts that are obtained from missing Reploids, found in various locations throughout the game's eight Maverick stages.</p><h2>Reploids/Parts</h2><p>The game has over a hundreds missing reploids in the game's levels - some of the Reploids offer specials parts that X or Zero can use. The special parts can help X &amp; Zero in certain ways. For example, one of the parts can allow X or Zero jump higher, or some can increase the power of the X-Buster or the Z Saber.</p><h2>Armors</h2><p>X has a total of four armors in the game, and each armor has certain abilities.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958041-2138008058_997810f5b2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958041\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5772870662461\" data-width=\"317\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 317px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958041-2138008058_997810f5b2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958041\"><img alt=\"The Falcon Armor.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958041-2138008058_997810f5b2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958041-2138008058_997810f5b2.jpg 317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" data-width=\"317\"></a><figcaption>The Falcon Armor.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Falcon Armor: Available from the start of game, the Falcon Armor gives X the ability to perform a dash in mid-air that will also damage enemies, perform the Giga Attack that damages all enemies on screen, and use special charged versions of the weapons obtained by the Maverick bosses.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958045-2138006146_4a595dc2fb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958045\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0460251046025\" data-width=\"478\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 478px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958045-2138006146_4a595dc2fb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958045\"><img alt=\"The Shadow Armor.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-width=\"611\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958045-2138006146_4a595dc2fb.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958045-2138006146_4a595dc2fb.jpg 478w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Shadow Armor.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958045-2138006146_4a595dc2fb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/958045-2138006146_4a595dc2fb.jpg 478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-width=\"611\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Shadow Armor.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Shadow Armor: The Shadow Armor has the ability to touch spiked areas with no consequence, take less damage, dash vertically by pressing up and jump, shoot Shurikens that shoot in random directions, and perform a special charged slash with the Z Saber.

Depending on which Capsule X finds, Dr. Light briefs him on what the upgrade does before allowing him to step into the Capsule to receive it (giving him a shiny new replacement piece for his armor).</p><ul><li><strong>Helmet Piece</strong> - Allows X to use his \"Item Tracer\", in which a cursor (shown on the screen) automatically zooms in to hidden passages. Found in Crystal Snail's stage.</li><li><strong>Body Piece</strong> - Allows X to perform the \"Giga Crush\" technique, which clears all enemies on the screen (but uses a gauge that only fills up by taking damage and can only be used once per level). X also takes 50% less damage from attacks. Found in Morph Moth's stage.</li><li><strong>Arm Pieces</strong> - Allows X to both charge up his special weapons (for an alternate, more powerful effect) and grants him an X-Buster on his other arm (allowing him to further charge his standard X-Buster, which fires two consecutive super-charged blasts that can cut through enemies). Found in Wheel Gator's stage.</li><li><strong>Leg Pieces</strong> - Allows X to <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/dash/3015-2290/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2290\">dash</a> in mid-air. Found in Overdrive Ostrich's stage.</li></ul><h3>Hidden Capsule</h3><p>Along with the four Capsules above, the game includes a very hidden fifth Capsule which grants X a powerful ability (in similar vein to the secret ability in the previous game).</p><p>If he manages to reach a certain point in the third stage of the X-Hunter's fortress after receiving all four armor parts and obtaining every Sub Tank and Life Up powerups, and then following a specific path (covered in spikes), he can reach a Capsule in which Dr. Light grants X the power to perform a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shoryuken/3015-496/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-496\">Shoryuken</a> (made famous by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ryu/3005-103/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-103\">Ryu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ken-masters/3005-212/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-212\">Ken</a> of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/capcom/3010-367/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom's</a> <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter/3025-331/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-331\">Street Fighter</a> series).</p><p>By inputting a specific combination (forward, then down, then down and forward, then the Attack button) while X is on the ground and has a full Life Energy gauge, X performs a powerful close-ranged rising <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/uppercut/3015-1128/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1128\">uppercut</a> that can deal serious damage to bosses.

It is the last game in the franchise to feature the original art and gameplay style of Mega Man X (as well as the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/password/3015-38/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-38\">password</a> system).</p><p>Set sometime after the events of Mega Man X2 (where X and the rebuilt Zero defeat the Maverick <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sigma/3005-1837/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1837\">Sigma</a> for the second time), the Maverick rebellion becomes neutralized due to the technology of Reploid scientist <a href=\"/dr-doppler/3005-28897/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28897\">Dr. Doppler</a>. Reformed Mavericks form an utopia near the scientist (named Dopple Town) and lived peacefully before they suddenly go berserk and cause mayhem. Believing Doppler to be responsible, X and Zero must defeat the eight Maverick leaders of Dopple Town and foil the mad scientist's plans (while surviving his henchmen, <a href=\"/bit/3005-28898/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28898\">Bit</a> and <a href=\"/byte/3005-28899/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28899\">Byte</a>, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/vile/3005-5052/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5052\">a mysterious Maverick</a>).</p><p>An enhanced version of the game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan (on April 26, 1996) and Europe (published by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-176/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-176\">Virgin Interactive</a> on March 1997). While the core game remains the same, it includes animated <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/full-motion-video/3015-604/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">full-motion video</a> cutscenes, a rearranged soundtrack, and new sound effects. This version was later released for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in Japan (on March 28, 1997) and North America (on October 5, 1998) and is included in the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-x-collection/3030-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1483\">Mega Man X Collection</a> compilation for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> (released on January 10, 2006).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay has only somewhat differed from <a href=\"/mega-man-x2/3030-19801/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19801\">Mega Man X2</a> by making the wall jumping slightly easier to preform while reploids become tougher. The gameplay compared to the Mega Man series is much more fast paced with more tricky and more powerful mavericks than ever giving rise to more difficult battles. As a side point, their battles can be completed faster than other bosses in previous games, as they are more susceptible to their weakness, and take more damage from their attacks.</p><h2>Boss Robots(Mavericks)</h2><p>At the end of every level X must fight a boss to proceed, and after fighting all 8 bosses he goes to the final fight against Doppler and his army. Here is a list of the boss robots in order to exploit all of their weaknesses.</p><figure data-align=\"right\"

has once again hidden some secret capsules that will enhance Mega Man X's abilities. When Mega Man X steps into one of these capsules, it will come to life and change the appearance of Mega Man X. Here are descriptions of some of the Capsules:</p><p><u><b>Boots</b></u>(Nothing required)</p><p>Gives X the ability to dash again while in the air</p><p>Location-Blizzard Buffalo's lair</p><p><u><b>Gun</b></u></p><p>(Boots and T.Fang)</p><p>Allows X to charge up one level and fire two powerful shots; also X can charge special weapons.</p><p>Location-Neon Tiger's lair</p><p><u><b>Helmet</b></u></p><p>(Gun and Triad T.)</p><p>A map will appear at the beginning of the level to show X where hidden items are located.</p><p>Location-Drill Rhino's lair</p><p><u><b>Armor</b></u></p><p>(Boots, G. Well and Gun)</p><p>Automatically creates a defense shield on Mega Man X's chassis that reduces damage by 50%. After getting hurt a shield will automatically form around X to lessen damage by 1/2</p><p>Location-Volt Catfish's lair</p><h3>Robot Ride Armor</h3><p>In addition to the armor capsules, Dr. Light has set out 4 different armors known as robot ride armor. Mega Man X and Zero must find these 4 armors, each with different capabilities and functions. The armor looks like a giant robot that they can activate by jumping into it. Once X finds an armor, he may use the armor in any stage where he may find the Robot Ride platforms.</p><p>If X has found an armor, the platform will activate. A menu will appear just to the left of the platform, so use the game pad or the arrow keys to select which armor X would like to use. While in the robot ride armor, Mega Man X and Zero will not be damaged. The armor can be damaged, but can be healed by returning to the platform. If the armor is destroyed, X cannot use it again until he enters a new stage. He can also jump out if need be by jumping while holding up on the D-pad.</p><p><u><b>Robot Ride Armors</b></u></p><p><b>Chimera</b></p><p><b>Hawk</b></p><p><b>Frog</b></p><p><b>Kangaroo</b></p><h2><b>Soundtrack</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2062809\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2062809\"><img alt=\"Cover Art\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cover Art\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cover Art</figcaption></figure><p>In 2005 Capcom released a 5-disc box set called Capcom Music Generation Rockman X1~6.

The enhanced remaster of the hugely successful original is mostly based on the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube </a>version of <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/3030-19467/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19467\">Twilight Princess</a> and developed by Australian developer <a href=\"/tantalus-media/3010-309/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-309\">Tantalus Media</a>, who had already proved themselves capable with the Wii U versions of <a href=\"/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29935\">Mass Effect 3: Special Edition</a> and <a href=\"/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut/3030-42021/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42021\">Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut</a> under their <a href=\"/straight-right/3010-8253/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8253\">Straight Right</a> label.</p><h2>Differences from Original Version</h2><p>Important to note is the fact that this remaster is based on the GameCube original, not the Wii version which mirrored the entire game world and featured a right-handed Link to compensate for the intended setup where players hold the Wiimote in their right hand. Twilight Princess HD thus features the traditional left-handed Link and reflects the world of Hyrule oriented the original GameCube way. The right-handed world layout, reflecting the Wii version, can be accessed by playing in Hero Mode.</p><h3>Visuals</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2815409\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2815409\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2815409-link-2__xlarge.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Most notably, the game comes with fully redrawn high-resolution textures, some of them completely new and slightly different looking from their originals. Some objects in the game have also received higher quality 3D models such as certain pillars or the exit door frame to Malo Mart in Castle Town. The strong bloom lighting from the original has been toned down in some areas, along with minor lighting changes and new graphical effects such as floor reflections, for example. However, a new dynamic lighting system as found in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd/3030-41348/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41348\">The Wind Waker HD</a> was not implemented. The same upgrade to a native 1080p rendering resolution (while keeping the 30 frames per second refresh rate from the original) as found in The Wind Waker HD is in effect in this game, too.</p><h3>User Interface &amp; GamePad Support</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2822951\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2822951\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822951-22.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Similar to The Wind Waker HD, the Wii U GamePad shows the inventory and allows for touch-manipulation such as assigning items via drag and drop along with quick access to some shortcuts. The HUD has also been adapted to resemble that of the previous console remaster with a cleaner style, smaller icons and +Control Pad shortcuts. Items can be equipped to four slots (X, Y, and R with ZL being saved for a specific yet to be revealed function) while the L button summons Midna. The touch-screen also features a dedicated shortcut icon that instantly triggers the wolf/Link transformation without having to summon and talk to Midna.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2815411\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2815411\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2815411-riding_epona-2__xlarge.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Wii U GamePad's gyroscope can also again be (optionally) used for motion control-enhanced aiming of projectile weapons. When aiming projectiles, players can switch between first-person aiming and third-person aiming (like in the Wii version) in the settings menu. While it initially appeared that third-person aiming was exclusive to the mirrored Hero Mode, it turned out both view styles are available in both game modes.</p><h3>New Item: Ghost Lantern</h3><p>The Ghost Lantern is a new item available in this version of the game. It resembles the lantern that Poes carry around with them and it functions as a more convenient detection method for Poes which can be used by Link in human form. The lamp starts glowing if a Poe is detected in the area.</p><h3>Tears of Light Collection</h3><p>The number of Tears of Light that players have to collect to revive the Spirits of Light and dispel the twilight has been reduced from 16 down to 12. Additionally, the spawn animation has been sped up and the tears now appear closer to the player.</p><h3>Hero Mode</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2822949\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2822949\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2822949-twilight-princess-hd-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A harder difficulty is available again as well. Hero Mode can be activated right from the start, without having to finish the game first (like in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/3030-26934/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26934\">Skyward Sword</a> or <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds/3030-42402/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42402\">A Link Between Worlds</a>). Hero Mode has Link take twice the amount of damage from enemies and eliminates heart drops. Additionally, Hero Mode presents the game world in its mirrored form as it appeared in the Wii version of the original with Link even holding the sword in his right hand.</p><p>It can be further enhanced by tapping a Ganondorf amiibo to increase the damage intake from enemies to four times the usual amount. In fact, the Ganondorf amiibo effectively allows for three types of \"Hero Mode\" while only one of them is officially called that.</p><ol><li>Hero Mode: receive 2x damage + right-handed Link mirrored Wii-version layout + no health-replenishing heart drops.</li><li>Hero Mode + Ganondorf amiibo: receive 4x damage + right-handed Link mirrored Wii-version layout + no health-replenishing heart drops.</li><li>Normal Mode + Ganondorf amiibo: receive 2x damage + left-handed Link original layout + health-replenishing heart drops.</li></ol><h3>amiibo Support</h3><p>All Zelda-series amiibo are supported.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Oblivion is an action-oriented role-playing game providing players with a world they can traverse at will. Though the core storyline provides a linear, mission-driven experience, the player is free to pursue a staggering number of side quests that slowly develop and improve their character. Players are free to explore the open world of Cyrodiil however they wish, giving Oblivion a unique Sandbox element. The game was developed by <a href=\"../../bethesda-softworks/65-786/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bethesda Softworks</a> for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Bethesda also released a Game Of The Year Edition and a Collector's Edition.</p><p>Todd Howard said that originally the easier route was to do a two year sequel, but through much persuasion he managed to convince the \"upper management\" to give them four years to work on Oblivion. This meant that the team would be developing the game for next gen consoles that didn't even exist yet. In fact, the team didn't get final hardware until the last six months or so of development.</p><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596804\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75135135135135\" data-width=\"370\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 370px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596804\"><img alt=\"The Great Gate\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11570/596804-_240552375.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" data-width=\"370\"></a><figcaption>The Great Gate</figcaption></figure><p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion takes place in the same universe as its predecessors; <a href=\"../../the-elder-scrolls-arena/61-7513/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arena</a>, <a href=\"../../the-elder-scrolls-daggerfall/61-1129/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daggerfall</a>, and <a href=\"../../the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/61-17367/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morrowind</a>, though its specific storyline is original. The game is set in the imperial province of <a href=\"../../cyrodiil/95-127/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyrodiil</a>, an expansive territory spanning several square miles. Oblivion casts the player as a prisoner within the jail of the <a href=\"../../the-imperial-city/95-1659/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Imperial City</a>, imprisoned for an unspecified crime. The player soon encounters the <a href=\"../../emperor-uriel-septim-vii/94-289/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emperor</a> himself (voiced by <a href=\"../../patrick-stewart/72-19670/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patrick Stewart</a>), who later dies and gives the player character the <a href=\"../../amulet-of-kings/93-1036/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amulet Of Kings</a> to give to his son <a href=\"../../martin-septim/94-1991/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin</a> (voiced by <a href=\"../../sean-bean/72-89880/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sean Bean</a>), the new heir to the throne, who the player has to protect from a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/daedra/3015-1826/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1826\">Daedric Prince</a> named <a href=\"../../mehrunes-dagon/94-2931/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mehrunes Dagon</a>. Dagon is the ruler of the hellish plane of Oblivion, and seeks to conquer the mortal realm with his Daedric armies and the help of a mysterious cult called the '<a href=\"../../mythic-dawn/92-1827/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mythic Dawn</a>'. At the same time, trans-dimensional portals known as <a href=\"../../oblivion-gate/93-871/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oblivion Gates</a> appear throughout Cyrodiil and spawn monsters across the landscape.</p><p>After leaving the prison, the player heads to Weynon Priory to locate a man named Jauffre, who is the Grandmaster of the Blades (the guards assigned to protect the Emperor). He directs the player to the city of <a href=\"../../kvatch/95-142/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kvatch</a>, where he believes the last son of Uriel Septim is located. The player heads there and manages to locate Martin; unfortunately, the entire city is being destroyed by Daedric forces, as an Oblivion Gate opened in the middle of it. The player hooks up with the guards defending Kvatch and after a lengthy battle manages to drive the Daedra out. Martin then agrees to travel to Weynon Priory to see Jauffre and get the Amulet of Kings. However, when they arrive they are attacked by Assassins. The player successfully repulses the invaders, but they discover that the Amulet of Kings is no longer in their possession.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1137481\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1137481\"><img alt=\"Mehrunes Dagon\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1137481-oblivion62.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Mehrunes Dagon</figcaption></figure><p>In order to track down the culprits, the player heads to the Imperial City and meets up with <a href=\"/baurus/3005-5760/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5760\">Baurus</a>, who was present when Uriel Septim was murdered. Together they discover the location of a Mythic Dawn shrine, the faction that orchestrated the assassination. The player infiltrates the shrine and manages to steal the Mysterium Xarxes, an evil tome written by Mehrunes Dagon himself. Martin then realizes that they need to open a portal to Mankar Camoran's Paradise, the man that is in possession of the Amulet of Kings. The player then goes treasure hunting, gathering up the necessary items needed to open the portal. He/she retrieves the Armor of Tiber Septim (which has the Divine's blood on it), a Great Welkynd Stone, and the Great Sigil Stone from the Great Gate. With these Martin is able to successfully open a portal to Paradise, and the player ventures into it. The player is able to kill Mankar Camoran and escapes with the Amulet of Kings.</p><p>Unfortunately, all hell has broken loose in the Imperial City. An Oblivion Gate opens, and Mehrunes Dagon himself makes an appearance to reign destruction of everything. A huge battle ensues, and the player escorts Martin to the Temple of the One. At the same time, Dagon smashes through the roof and is about to kill both of them when Martin makes the ultimate sacrifice. He fuses all of the powers and transforms into the Avatar of Akatosh. The two of them battle, and Martin is able to defeat Dagon. However, the creature he has turned into freezes into stone, an eternal monument representing his ultimate sacrifice to save Cyrodiil.</p><h3>Side Quests</h3><p>Apart from the main quest, numerous guilds offer to recruit the player; each with different specialties and flavors. The Fighters Guild and Mages Guild quest lines are pretty straight-forward, while others, like the Arena make the player get creative against progressively difficult A.I. gladiators. The <a href=\"../../the-dark-brotherhood/92-2307/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Brotherhood</a> and <a href=\"../../the-thieves-guild/92-2321/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thieves Guild</a> quest lines require the player to murder and steal, respectively. Apart from the guild quests there are many other quests in Cyrodiil that lead to great rewards.</p><p>Many quests can be completed in more than one way. For example, there is one quest where a player is asked to retrieve a special sword. Once they get the sword, they realize that it clearly belongs to the Castle of Chorral, and at that point they can either return it to the castle or the quest giver, with both options offering different rewards. In addition to side quests are shrine quests that can be taken on when \"speaking\" to a shrine. There are multiple shrines in the game, each one requiring the player to be a certain level and to make a certain offer before giving the quest. Once the quest is completed, the shrine will give them a reward. One of the possible rewards is the Skeleton Key, which is an unbreakable lockpick.</p><h3>Visuals and Modification</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415343\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415343\"><img alt=\"Bloom effects and HDR lighting are all present in Cyrdodiil\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bloom effects and HDR lighting are all present in Cyrdodiil\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1415343-elderscrollsoblivionscreenshot11.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bloom effects and HDR lighting are all present in Cyrdodiil</figcaption></figure><p>Upon release, the game was noted for being visually striking, providing gorgeous vistas and realistic, sprawling environments for the player to explore. The development team worked from real photographs to deliver the best looking game world they could. While <a href=\"../../the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/61-17367/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morrowind</a> featured mostly smoothed over terrain, Oblivion has a much bigger focus on flora. Environments were procedurally generated allowing the landscape to be created very quickly. (They even used SpeedTree!) The draw distance in Oblivion is very lengthy, allowing players to see very far out.</p><p>Dynamic weather and day/night cycles give Oblivion a realistic feel. At any time the weather can change from sunny to overcast to rainy then back to sunny. The weather also fits certain parts of the game world: if the player goes to the murky swamps, it's probably going to be raining a lot. Likewise, if they go up into the mountains it will probably be snowing.</p><p>Bethesda noted the extreme popularity of the previous game, Morrowind, and developed Oblivion to be open to user modification. Soon after release fans began to modify everything from the game's core balance mechanics and inventory interface to specific environmental textures and even something as seemingly insignificant as the effect when drunk.</p><h3>Customization</h3><p>The game allows players to have highly <a href=\"../../customizable-characters/92-155/\" rel=\"nofollow\">customizable characters</a>. Their gender, looks, race, and class (custom or default), are all interchangeable. Each class features a specialization mechanic for the twenty one skills, seven major skills, and a bonus for two of the eight different attributes. At the beginning of the game, players choose a race and can alter their character's appearances in many ways, such as adjusting the height of the player character's nose to changing how big their lips are.</p><h3>Changes from Morrowind</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180546\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180546\"><img alt=\"Up close and personal\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Up close and personal\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/180546-obps311b.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Up close and personal</figcaption></figure><p>Certain features from Morrowind are not included, with primarily armor and weapon types and skills simplified. For example, Wakizashis and <a href=\"../../shuriken/93-51/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Throwing Stars</a> are not present in the game, as is also the case with the skills Long Blade, Medium Blade and Short Blade. Another important change to the player's interaction with the game world is the removal of the ' <a href=\"../../levitation/92-1117/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Levitate</a>' spell. Players are now able to instantly travel to locations they have previously visited. The Journal, a focus of significant criticism in Morrowind, is a lot more accessible and user-friendly. All conversations with <a href=\"../../non-player-character/92-967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPCs</a> now involve full voice-acting, unlike the text-based approach of Morrowind. Another key difference is the fact that enemies did not scale in Morrowind, but do scale in Oblivion based upon the player character's level. Arguably the biggest and most noticeable change from Morrowind is the combat itself. Morrowind took the traditional \"dice roll\" combat approach which determined whether the player controlled character hit the enemies based upon stats, as well as random chance. This made the game play and feel more like traditional pen and paper RPGs. Oblivion took a more modern approach and essentially made it so if the player controlled character made contact with the enemy, that said enemy took damage. (Every enemy also has a health bar so the player can see how much damage they are causing).</p><h3>Rating Controversy</h3><p>Originally, Oblivion was rated T for Teen by the ESRB. However, PC modders soon dug up nude character model art files within the code and applied them to the game, allowing people to play as a topless female character. Around this time, the ESRB also found out about some of the games gruesome violence that they were not aware of when rating the game.</p><p>When a game is ready to be rated by the ESRB, the developers submit a questionnaire about the game and a video showing the game's most extreme content. These videos can range from a few minutes of footage to hours of gameplay. The ESRB examines these and rates the game based on what they see. (The ESRB consists of volunteer members who have no affiliation with the game being rated). The ESRB claimed that Bethesda purposefully kept the violence they saw out of their reports to get the game a T rating. They also accused Bethesda of including nudity in the game without telling them. Bethesda responded by saying they did not create nude character art in the code and that the topless mods were created by the community.</p><h2>The Tamrielic Continent</h2><h3>Provinces</h3><p>Tamriel

Also listed are the diseases that some of the creatures can infect the player character with.</p><p>When infected with a disease, players can get rid of it by using potions or praying at a chapel.

They are very quick and have forward-jumping attacks. There are many variations of the goblin, thus warranting its own section. They are all found in the outdoors, caves, mines, and forts. Goblins have a 25% chance of dropping lockpicks.</p><p>Goblins are divided into tribes. There are seven tribes in total, they are: bloody Hand, Dust Eater, Rock Biter, Sharp Tooth, Skull Breaker, Three Feather, and White Skin. It is not uncommon to see goblins of different tribes fighting each other.

When having a conversation, the player usually selects from a list of topics that they want to know more about. Occasionally they'll be able to choose an actual dialogue option that can steer a quest in a particular direction. One of the more important options is the Rumors subject. By choosing this, the NPC will tell them about a random rumor about the town they are in or its surroundings, and occasionally a quest can be gained from it.</p><p>Players can also activate a persuasion minigame where they try to get the NPC to like them better by telling jokes, admiring them, etc. The speechcraft skill affects the NPCs disposition towards the player character. A higher disposition is necessary for many quests in order to get someone to provide more information.</p><h2>Leveling Up</h2><p>Oblivion uses a unique leveling feature that's not seen in many games. Rather than have players earn experience from killing enemies, completing quests, etc., players must practice their major skills before they can advance to the next level. For example, if one wanted to play as a thief, one would level up their character by sneaking and practicing skills associated with thieves. A thief wouldn't level up by casting spells or using battle axes, although leveling up from doing so is still possible if it's a major skill. Likewise, a mage wouldn't advance by sneaking and using swords as quickly as they would by casting spells, and a sword-wielding soldier wouldn't make much progress by throwing fireballs.</p><p>A player can still level up when not in combat. One of the skills in the game is athletics. By running, the player character is increasing their athletics skill. Whenever they jump, the acrobatics skill increases. Because of this, it's entirely possible to advance a level by running.</p><h2>Attributes</h2><p>Attributes are the player character's personal abilities in different fields. At the beginning of the game they all start at 40, except for Luck which starts at 50. They are affected by what race they choose, and as they level up they can put more points into them. Each attribute, except for luck, is associated with 3 different skills. If the player character levels up those skills, they'll be able to put points into that attribute.</p><ul><li><b>Strength:</b> Strength is most important to characters that work primarily by dealing melee damage. It also determines how much the player can carry before becoming encumbered. Every point in Strength has these effects: 5 lbs. to carrying capacity, 1 to Fatigue Stat, and 0.66% to melee damage. Associated Skills: <i>Blade, Blunt,</i> and <i>Hand-to-Hand.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Intelligence:</b> Boosts Magicka slightly. Every point in Intelligence gives the player character 2 Magicka. Associated Skills: <i>Alchemy, Conjuration,</i> and <i>Mysticism.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Willpower:</b> Boosts the player character's fatigue resistance and also increases their rate of magicka regeneration. Every point in Willpower provides 1 Fatigue. Associated Skills: <i>Alteration, Destruction,</i> and <i>Restoration.</i> Magicka regeneration increases with every point put into willpower, but the benefit gets smaller over time. The time it takes to recharge from 0 to full Magicka at some Willpower milestones is as follows:</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>0 Willpower: 131 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>25 Willpower: 80 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>50 Willpower: 58 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>75 Willpower: 45 seconds</li></ul><ul><li>100 Willpower: 35 seconds</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li><b>Agility:</b> Agility is a stat that is good for both melee and ranged characters. It increases the ability to avoid getting knocked down by melee hits, but it also adds to damage with bows. Every point in Agility has the following effects: 1 to Fatigue, 0.66% damage with bows, and increased resistance to knockdowns. Associated Skills: <i>Security, Sneak,</i> and <i>Marksman.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Speed:</b> Speed boosts the alacrity of attack and movement. Every point in Speed adds 0.44% movement speed. Associated Skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, and Light Armor.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Endurance:</b> Boosts health, essential for melee fighters. Every point of Endurance provides 2 starting Health, and 0.1 Health per level (rounded down). Associated Skills: <i>Armorer, Block,</i> and <i>Heavy Armor.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Personality:</b> Personality affects people's <i>starting</i> disposition toward the player character in conversations, though if they have enough money, the right spells, or are good enough at the Speechcraft mini-game, starting disposition is irrelevant. Every point of Personality provides 0.25 points to NPC starting dispositions, so it takes 4 points to increase their disposition by 1. Associated Skills: <i>Illusion, Mercantile,</i> and <i>Speechcraft.</i></li></ul><ul><li><b>Luck:</b> Luck doesn't govern any skills. However, it has a direct effect on all of skills, because the higher the Luck, the better skills will perform. Every point of Luck above 50 provides 0.4 to all skills. Conversely, every point of luck below 50 provides -0.4 to all skills. Luck's effect on skills is detailed in the following equation and table:</li></ul><blockquote><p><i>Skill Level ((Luck-50) X 0.4) = Modified Skill Level</i></p></blockquote><p>If the player has a 50 in a skill, their Luck score would affect it like this:</p><blockquote><ul><li>10 Luck -- 34 Skill (-16)</li></ul><ul><li>20 Luck -- 38 Skill (-12)</li></ul><ul><li>30 Luck -- 42 Skill (-8)</li></ul><ul><li>40 Luck -- 46 Skill (-4)</li></ul><ul><li>50 Luck -- 50 Skill (No change)</li></ul><ul><li>60 Luck -- 54 Skill ( 4)</li></ul><ul><li>70 Luck -- 58 Skill ( 8)</li></ul><ul><li>80 Luck -- 62 Skill ( 12)</li></ul><ul><li>90 Luck -- 66 Skill ( 16)</li></ul><ul><li>100 Luck -- 70 Skill ( 20)</li></ul></blockquote><h3>Skills and Associated Categories</h3><ul><li><b>Combat:</b> Block, Armorer, Heavy Armor, Blunt, Blade, Athletics, Hand-to-Hand</li><li><b>Magic:</b> Destruction, Alteration, Illusion, Conjuration, Mysticism, Restoration, Alchemy</li><li><b>Stealth:</b> Security, Sneak, Acrobatics, Light Armor, Marksman, Mercantile, Speechcraft</li></ul><h2>Birthsigns</h2><ul><li><b>The Apprentice</b></li></ul><p>Adds 100 points to the players Magicka attribute, but also gives them a weakness to Magic.</p><ul><li><b>The Atronach</b></li></ul><p>Confers a 50% Spell Absorption to recharge Magicka, as it cannot be recharged through resting under this birthsign.</p><ul><li><b>The Lady</b></li></ul><p>Confers a bonus of 10 points to Willpower and Endurance.</p><ul><li><b>The Lover</b></li></ul><p>The player can paralyze an opponent for 10 by kissing them, but loses 120 points of Fatigue by doing so.</p><ul><li><b>The Lord</b></li></ul><p>The player can regenerate health up to 90, but gains a 25% weakness to fire.</p><ul><li><b>The Mage</b></li></ul><p>Adds 50 points to Magicka.</p><ul><li><b>The Ritual</b></li></ul><p>Grants the Mara's Gift power once a day as a Restore Health spell to use.</p><ul><li><b>The Serpent</b></li></ul><p>Gives the Serpent spell to cause a slow but potent poison on touch, while also ridding the player of magic and costing 100 Fatigue.</p><ul><li><b>The Shadow</b></li></ul><p>Grants the Moonshadow power once a day, causing the player to become invisible for 60 seconds.</p><ul><li><b>The Steed</b></li></ul><p>Adds a bonus of 20 to the player's Speed.</p><ul><li><b>The Thief</b></li></ul><p>Adds a bonus of 10 points to Speed, Agility, and Luck.</p><ul><li><b>The Tower</b></li></ul><p>Allows the player to open an Average lock or less once per day.

The player can join all five, but some guild rules may conflict with others. Each guild has it's own unique storyline rather than random tasks to complete.</p><ul><li><b>The Mages Guild:</b> The Mages guild is for magic-users, although use of magic isn't completely necessary to complete the quest line. Those who join the guild get access to exclusive spells and the ability to craft their own spells and enchantments.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Fighters Guild:</b> The Fighters guild is for warriors, although melee weapons aren't completely necessary to complete the quest line. Those who join the guild get access to exclusive weapons and training.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Thieves Guild:</b> The Thieves guild is for rogues and thieves. Those who join the guild can sell stolen property and remove bounties on their heads for a price without losing their stolen goods.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Dark Brotherhood:</b> The Dark Brotherhood is for assassins. Those who join the guild get access to exclusive armor and weapons for silently killing enemies. Unlike the other guilds, the Dark Brotherhood cannot be joined by simply walking into a building and asking. The player character needs to kill an innocent, and the next time they sleep they'll be visited by <a href=\"/lucien-lachance/3005-1799/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1799\">Lucien Lachance</a> who will begin the initiation process.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The Arena:</b> The Arena is for brave adventurers who wish to test their mettle against others. Those who join the guild get access to battles and the recognition of all the people of Cyrodill once the player becomes Grand Champion. The player also gets to have <a href=\"/adoring-fan/3005-4114/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4114\">The Adoring Fan</a> follow them around.</li></ul><h2>Voice Talents</h2><p>Some really popular actors gave their voice to some of thEme characters in the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Voice Talent</th><th>Character(s)</th></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Patrick Stewart</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Emperor Uriel Septim</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Sean Bean</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Martin Septim</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Terence Stamp</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Mankar Camoran</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Ralph Cosham</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Jauffre</a> / Vincent Valtieri</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Wes Johnson</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Dyus</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Michael Mack</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Baurus</a> / <a href=\"/\">Owyn</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Craig Sechler</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">High Chancellor Ocato</a> / Falcar / Alval Uvani / Faelian</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/\">Jeff Baker</a></td><td><a href=\"/\">Haskill</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The Elder Scrolls IV: The Knights of Nine</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367621\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367621\"><img alt=\"Knights of the Nine is an official mod\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Knights of the Nine is an official mod\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7499/367621-tes4_knights02.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Knights of the Nine is an official mod</figcaption></figure><p>The Knights of the Nine is the first major plugin released by <a href=\"../../bethesda-game-studios/65-3076/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bethesda Softworks</a> for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unlike many of Bethesda's add-ons for earlier games, which were large expansion packs that took place away from the world of the base game, Knights of the Nine is much smaller in scope, providing ten or so new quests into the existing lands of Cyrodiil. In this way, it is very similar to various guild sidequests found in Oblivion.</p><p>Upon installing Knights of the Nine, the player hears rumors of an attack on the church in the town of Anvil. After visiting the Prophet, who tells tale of the second coming of the evil Umaril, the player must reform the order of the Knights of the Nine and search for the lost Crusader's Relics before finally taking on Umaril himself.</p><p>Besides the new quests, Knights of the Nine also adds new Ayleid ruins, forts, and caves, as well as the Priory of the Nine, which becomes the knights' base of operations. Minor changes are also made to a few existing locations, such as the aforementioned ruined Anvil Chapel. Additionally, several new enemies and items are added to the game, which the player can then use throughout the rest of Oblivion.</p><p>Originally, Knights of the Nine was available as downloadable content from Bethesda's website, as well as on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Additionally, it was available on a retail disc that also included seven of the other eight official plug-ins (the Fighter's Stronghold is not included). Later, Knights of the Nine was included along with the Shivering Islands retail box, as well as included in the Game Of The Year edition of Oblivion. As the PS3 version of Oblivion was released later than the PC and 360 versions, Knights of the Nine was included on the Oblivion game disc.</p><h2>The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219515\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219515\"><img alt=\"Entering the Realm of Madness\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Entering the Realm of Madness\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/458/219515-si_17b.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Entering the Realm of Madness</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../the-elder-scrolls-iv-shivering-isles/61-10740/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shivering Isles</a> is the first and only <b>expansion pack</b> for Oblivion. The extra content leads the player to the Daedric prince <a href=\"../../sheogorath/94-2792/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sheogorath</a>'s Realm of Madness, which consists of an entirely new map to explore. The realm is effectively split down the middle. The \"light\" side, Mania, is filled with inhabitants delirious and manic and a color saturated environment to reflect that. The \"dark\" side, Dementia, is inhabited by the paranoid and depressed, as reflected in its grim environments. The capital city of New Sheoth is similar with Crucible (Dementia), Bliss (Mania), and the Palace District (exact middle and home of Sheogorath), reflecting the two sides of the world, its god and his divided nature.</p><p>In the main quest, the player is recruited by Sheogorath to stop a Ragnarok-style event called the Greymarch. Jyggalag, Daedric Prince of Order and the polar opposite to the Prince of Madness, returns at the end of every era to purge the Realm of Madness, forcing Sheogorath to rebuild his domain. With the player as his champion, Sheogorath plans to fight back. He sends the player on many quests to try and put an end to the Greymarch.</p><p>However, the player ultimately fails and Sheogorath transforms into Jyggalag. The player is able to defeat Jyggalag, and when the fight is over Jyggalag explains that because his realm was expanding so fast, the other Daedric Princes put a curse on him that causes Sheogorath to turn into Jyggalag at the end of each era and thus experience the Greymarch over and over again. Because of this, Sheogorath, against his will, destroys his own realm at the end of each era and has to rebuild it (only the destroy it again). He thanks the player for putting a halt to the cycle and considers him/her the new Sheogorath.</p><h2>Collector's Edition</h2><p>Upon release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Bethesda announced a Collector's Edition version for the PC and Xbox 360.

After investigating the issue, they were surprised to find out that the new Radiant AI system was causing the death. They discovered that the guards in the prison would eventually run out of food and get hungry, and they would all go to the cell, kill the prisoner, and take his food.</li></ul><h2>Reception</h2><p>Oblivion has received almost entirely positive reviews. Critics have praised the game's scope and how it immerses the player in the experience. On Metacritic, the game holds a 94/100 rating for the Xbox 360 and PC versions and a 93/100 rating for the Playstation 3 version.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion requires 6.8GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Divinity: Original Sin was released on June, 30th 2014 on PC and Mac. An enhanced edition of the game, which includes additional story bits and new gameplay options is currently is released on PC, PS4 and Xbox One. This version (even on consoles) is free to players that already bought the original PC version.</p><p>The game was Kickstarter funded.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game allows players to control a party, which initially consists of two characters:</p><ul><li>A woman who has recently been resurrected</li><li>A condemned warrior who has suffered years of agony and torture</li></ul><p>Additional characters can later be recruited in the game world itself (there are four story-specific pre-made characters in the game currently) or in the game's hub world. Characters recruited in the hub world can be further customized to perfectly fit the player's party needs.</p><p>During the course of the game, players will either control the characters independently in the single player mode or have separate players controlling separate characters in multiplayer co-op. Along with multiplayer co-op control, a co-op dialogue decision system (using a stone/paper/scissors mini-game based on player stats, much like that found in Star Wars: The Old Republic) will allow both players the ability to make decisions within the game's world.</p><p>Almost everything can be directly interacted with, while some objects can offer bonuses. One example is that a mushroom on the ground can be picked up and applied to a weapon in order to give it a few stacks of a poison damage buff.</p><p>The game also features a magic system that allows players to take advantage of reactive spells. As an example, if a player casts an ice spell and it freezes something, the player can then cast fire and it will cause the ice to melt. After that, the player could cast a lightning spell and it will electrocute the enemy in the melted ice water.</p><p>Divinity: Original Sin shipped with a full level editor using many of the same tools that Larian has used to make the Divinity games in recent years, and any adventures/areas/etc will be made available through direct interface built into the game for players to download and use. The world itself is far more interactive than any previous iteration of the games.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game follows two characters, a man and a woman, who are part of an organization called the Source Hunters, which is tasked with eradicating the dangerous magic known as The Source and everyone that's trying to wield or control it.</p><p>They soon uncover a conspiracy by The Immaculates, a hidden cult, that has been mining and monopolizing the dangerous mineral Tenebrium for yet unknown reasons. The cult is led by a being called The Conduit which is in command of immortal and indestructible warriors known as Death Knights.</p><p>Along the way the Source Hunters can recruit Madora, a female knight that despises all magic; Jahan, a wizard that paradoxically hates most forms of magic; Bairdotr, a ranger that was raised by a bear and Wolgraff, a rouge who is mute because sorcerers stole his voice when he was younger.</p><p>Eventually the party comes across magical crystals strewn all over the world known as Star Stones. Upon finding the first crystal they immediately get transported to a place that exists outside of known spacetime called The Homestead.</p><p>It is here they meet an imp historian, Zixzax, who has been ordered by the gods to record everything that has ever happened until the end of time. From him, and by collecting more and more Star Stones, the party learns the secrets behind the Immaculates, The Death Knights, their own past and the universe ending threat that looms over everything, known as The Void.</p><p>Thus they embark on a quest to stop the Immaculates and hinder The Void from destroying all of creation.</p><h2>Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>The game's Kickstarter campaign was very successful, garnering over $940,000 against a $400,000 goal.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3><strong>Windows</strong></h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th scope=\"col\"><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>OS</strong>: Windows XP SP3 or higher</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core2 Duo E6600 or equivalent</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i5 2400 or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Memory</strong>: 2048 MB RAM</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Memory</strong>: 4096 MB RAM</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>GPU</strong>: HD Intel Graphics 4000 or NVIDIA® GeForce® 8800 GT (512 MB) or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 4850 or equivalent</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>GPU</strong>: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 550 ti 1GB ram or or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 6XXX or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 9.0c</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 9.0c</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Sound Card</strong>: DirectX9c compliant</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Sound Card</strong>: DirectX9c compliant</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Mac</strong></h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"><strong>Minimum</strong></th><th scope=\"col\"><strong>Recommended</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>OS</strong>: OS X 10.8.5</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>OS</strong>: OS X 10.9.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core 2 Duo</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel i5 or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Memory</strong>: 4 GB RAM</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Memory</strong>: 4 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>GPU</strong>: Intel HD Graphics 3000/4000</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>GPU</strong>: Intel Iris (Iris Pro) or ATI™ Radeon™ HD 6XXX or higher or NVidia 6xx series or higher</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Hard Drive</strong>: 10 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Additional Notes</strong>: HD3000 &amp; HD4000 benefit from 8Gb of memory</td><td colspan=\"1\"><strong>Additional Notes</strong>: HFS+ filesystem with case-sensitivity is not yet supported</td></tr></tbody></table>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The sixth entry of the Might and Magic series would introduce the gameplay system that would be utilized in the following sequels. Despite the heavy overhaul, the basic goals would remain the same as a party-based, open world RPG. Players would continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet.</p><p>In this game, the players must stop an invasion of their world by the demon-like Kreegan who have arrived in meteors that have fallen to their world. Unlike the previous games, Mandate of Heaven would start in a world shared by its tactical cousin,</p><p><a href=\"/heroes-of-might-and-magic-ii/3030-20324/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20324\"> Heroes of Might and Magic II</a>, otherwise known as Enroth. Events from that game would also play a part within its backdrop, although players need not have played it in order to understand what was required of them in this iteration.</p><p>The Manual was particularly noteworthy for continuing the tradition of providing plenty of expanded fiction encompassing the world of Might and Magic. In particular, the manual and the conventions of the game were described by a wizard named Klavis Verge who breaks the <a href=\"/breaking-the-fourth-wall/3015-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-138\">fourth wall </a>to guide the player through its pages. Peripherals such as the mouse and keyboard are treated as tools in the wizard's descriptions, as one example, and the PC is simply described as a window to another world.</p><p>As was a tradition of the series, a color map showing the world of Enroth was also included.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1232331-mm6_map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1232331\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78\" data-width=\"750\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1232331-mm6_map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1232331\"><img alt=\"Included map\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1232331-mm6_map.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1232331-mm6_map.jpg 750w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20618/1232331-mm6_map.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1232331-mm6_map.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Included map</figcaption></figure><p>Previous games in the series held back the sci-fi aspect of the game until close to the very end when everything would be revealed, but with Mandate of Heaven, this was introduced somewhat from the start. Players unfamiliar with the extensive back story of the series, however, could ignore the introductory cut scene and dive into the game suspecting nothing and focus only on the introduction provided by the manual.</p><p>The introduction of the game narrates the arrival of the demonic Kreegans in fiery meteors that crash into the land of Enroth. Four characters are confronted with the invasion in the town of Sweetwater and narrowly escape with the help of the mighty wizard, Falagar, who trains and prepares them for their return to the world in order to save it. They come upon five letters from King Roland and one letter from the devil king, Xenofex, at an abandoned goblin camp, all of which are included in the manual of the game.</p><p>Through the letters, and an introduction by a wizard named Klavis Verge, the events that had also led up to the present following the arrival of the Kreegan invasion are recounted. Key to the success of the player's quest lies within what has become known as the Mandate of Heaven.</p><p>Klavis Verge also goes on to explain that the Mandate has been called by some as the moral order of the universe, to do what is right instead of what is done to one's own advantage. If a king throws aside force and instead rules by moral order, then they can safely sit upon the throne. If not, if they use their power for personal greed and power, then they have lost the Mandate of Heaven.</p><p>King Roland, the ruler of Enroth, has gone forth to seek out and destroy the demonic creatures said to be terrorizing his distant holds, but he is betrayed by one of his own. His army is ambushed and he, along with his court wizard, Tanir, and Sir Ragnar, are captured. To make matters worse, a doomsday cult has also found purchase within the lives of the people of Enroth. The Temple of Baa, as Klavis Verge also explains, seeks to destroy the unspoken bonds between god and humanity.</p><p>With the loss of King Roland and his army, the Temple seeks to convince the people of Enroth that he has lost the Mandate of Heaven and that they must force his dynasty from the throne paving the way for their own followers. Only the King's son is left behind, and many fear that he may not have the strength to resist this conspiracy of power. Even the lords that squabble over what to do in the King's absence are more concerned for themselves than in supporting the Prince and rumors abound dare to whisper that one of them may even belong to the Temple.</p><p>Thus, it falls to the party of four to see their way through the land and complete its challenges in order to save the kingdom and drive out the Kreegan once and for all.</p><p>Through several quests, they manage to gain the help of the Regent Humphrey in Castle Ironfist who asks them for help in locating the King. But to do so, they must first find counsel with the Oracle of Enroth. However, the members of the Enrothian Council must agree to their audience and not all of them have the King's best interests at heart. Even worse, each one has a special quest that the player must perform in order to earn their respective support. Through several trials, the party unmasks the noble that is a member of the Temple of Baa but before they can capture him, he escapes. The remaining members, however, allow the party to consult the Oracle.</p><p>The Oracle, as the player will discover, is actually a computer named Melian created by the Ancients who is the Guardian of Enroth. However, it is damaged and requires special memory crystals to repair it. Questing for these and returning with them, the party restores the Oracle who then informs them of the true nature of their enemies. He tells them that the weapons they need to defeat the tougher versions of the Kreegan lie below in the Planetary Control Center, but it is locked and only a Control Cube will allow access and that the only one left on Enroth can be found in the desert of Dragonsand.</p><p>Beneath Dragonsand is the Tomb of VARN which was the original ship that the colonists had used to populate the world of Enroth. After searching through the ship for scrolls containing the required passwords needed to access the main control room, the party must fight through its robot guardians. They discover the Control Cube and bring it back to the Oracle, accessing the Planetary Control Room in order to retrieve the necessary weapons said to have been forged during the Time of Wonders</p><p>They manage to find the Control Cube and then acquire a spell needed to protect the world should they fail in battle against the Kreegans. They make their way back to the town of Sweetwater where the Kreegan Hive has built itself up, make their way through the hordes, and destroy the power reactor at its heart. On their way out, they are confronted by the Kreegan Queen and her army and are forced to fight through their ranks and escape before the destroyed reactor explodes, taking the Hive and Sweetwater with it.</p><p>They are ultimately hailed as heroes at the end, but mysterious forces watching from afar thank them for saving Enroth for far darker reasons.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1232335-mm6_town.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1232335\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1232335-mm6_town.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1232335\"><img alt=\"In Town\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1232335-mm6_town.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20618/1232335-mm6_town.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20618/1232335-mm6_town.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20618/1232335-mm6_town.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>In Town</figcaption></figure><p>Mandate of Heaven is the first game in the series to eschew the <a href=\"/grid-based-movement/3015-1318/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1318\">grid-based movement </a>of the previous series for a free roaming system allowing for a complete 360 degree range of maneuverability, similar to that found in titles such as <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-arena/3030-7513/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7513\">Elder Scrolls: Arena </a>or <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall/3030-1129/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1129\">Daggerfall</a>. It also used 3D graphics to render the environment of its world although it also used them in conjunction with animated 2D sprites representing monsters and special effects among other assets. Further, the game utilized an extensive number of cut-scenes and rendered FMVs.</p><p>Players were called upon to create a four-character party, a step down from the six-member system supported by previous entries in the series; although it would follow this up with an extensive overhaul of its class and skill systems.</p><p>Depending on which class is chosen for each character, they will start with two preset skills, and the player will be able to choose two extra starting skills, with the available options depending on the character's class. Though each character only starts with four skills, they can always learn any other skills allowed by their class from teachers spread throughout the land. The six available classes are Knight, Cleric, Sorcerer, Paladin, Archer, and Druid. Each class can be promoted to greater versions of their starting class should they complete a corresponding epic quest</p><p>The first set of skills is weapon skills, including Staff, Sword, Dagger, Axe, Spear, Bow, and Mace. Next there are the armor skills, consisting of Leather, Chain, Plate, and Shield. The various schools of magic are Fire Air, Water, Earth, Spirit, Body, Mind, Light, and Dark, though Light and Dark are not available to any class at the beginning.</p><p>Finally there are the miscellaneous skills, denoting all skills which do not fit into any other category: Identify, Merchant, Repair, Bodybuilding, Meditation, Perception, Diplomacy, Disarm Trap, and Learning. With all skills, characters may eventually find teachers who can teach an upgrade to Expert and eventually Master level of the skill.</p><p>This gameplay system would be used throughout the rest of the series with minor changes between each iteration.</p><h3>Time</h3><p>Time is also an important consideration in the game as day and night cycles pass offering new opportunities or in making things more difficult depending on the location. Several quests in the game are also tied to their own schedule, meaning that when an NPC says that they are giving a month to complete a quest, they mean it. This can also determine when the safest time might be for the party to rest and recoup their strength if they are out in the wilderness.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>The statistics for each character are limited only by the number of levels that they may earn, among other factors such as magical effects, allowing for tremendously high numbers that break the typical \"18\" cap. However, if any statistic drops to 0, it will result in immediate death for that character.</p><p>The basic statistics used in the game seem derived from the Dungeons and Dragons model of statistics, although carry different names so as to differentiate themselves. They are:</p><ul><li><b>Intellect</b> - General knowledge. Important to sorcerers as it can affect spell points. Important to archers later on at higher levels as they begin learning sorcerer spells.</li><li><b>Might</b> - Raw strength. Important to any fighting class such as Knights and Paladins. Affects the damage a character can inflict in melee combat.</li><li><b>Personality</b> - A character's general degree of appeal to others. Particularly important to clerics as it affects their pool of spell points. Important to paladins when, at higher levels, they begin learning cleric spells.</li><li><b>Endurance</b> - Stamina. Affects how many hit points a character initially has to start with and will gain every time they level. Particularly important to fighters.</li><li><b>Speed</b> - Agility and general quickness affecting initiative. A faster character improves (increases) their Armor Class rating making them harder to hit.</li><li><b>Accuracy</b> - A character's ability to land hits during combat. This is particularly important to archers.</li><li><b>Luck</b> - Measures the general chances of a character succeeding when all else seems to have failed. Random and unpredictable.</li></ul><h3>Classes</h3><ul><li><strong>Knights </strong>are the workhorses of the fighting class, coming onto the scene with the largest selection of weapons and armor; in fact, they are able to eventually learn any and all weapon and armor skills. Knights begin with the greatest number of hit points of any class and gain the most hit points when they advance in level. Knights can be promoted to Cavalier status (gaining two hit points per level) and again to become an all-out Champion (gaining another two hit points per level). Being the quintessential warriors, knights have no mind for magic, and so may never learn spells or the Meditation skill.</li><li><strong>Clerics</strong> are adventurous, spell-casting holy men who are mediocre fighters. Their magic is most powerful in the areas of healing and defense. Clerics can learn from the mirrored paths of the Light and Dark magics, and the awesome spells available in those realms. For weapons, however, Clerics can only choose the mace, staff, or bow, though they are able to learn all armor skills except for Plate. With much diligence and study, Clerics can ascend to Priest (gaining one hit point and spell point per level), and eventually High Priest (gaining another spell point and an extra hit point).</li><li><strong>Sorcerers </strong>are students of Elemental magic, concentrating on offensive and utilitarian magic. Downright rotten fighters, they are barely able to use the dagger, the staff, or the bow effectively, and may not even attempt to use any other weapon types. Locked out of all armor skill but leather, they also have the lowest hit points of all classes. Despite these shortcomings, Sorcerers command tremendous offensive spells, and also have access to the paths of Light and Dark magic, the most powerful wizardry in the land. With much spell casting experience, Sorcerers can be transformed into Wizards (gaining one hit point and one spell point per level) and then to Archmages (gaining another spell point and another hit point).</li><li><strong>Paladins </strong>cross the line between Knight and Cleric, performing both roles well, though not as well as either of the more focused classes alone. Like Knights, Paladins can learn to use any type of weapon or armor; they simply don't have as many choices to begin with. Paladins begin with the Spirit realm of magic, and can later learn to use the Clerical Mind and Body realms. They are, however, restricted from learning the powers of the realms of Light and Dark, as well as the Elemental magics. Paladins who remain true to their cause may achieve the rank of Crusader (gaining one hit point and one spell point per level) and ultimately ascend to Hero (gaining another hit point and spell point per level).</li><li><strong>Archers </strong>are another type of hybrid, in this case between Knight and Sorcerer. Archers may learn to use any type of weapon, although their specialty is the bow. Their discipline prevents their use of shield or plate armor. An Archer's talent for spell-casting begins with the Air realm of magic, and may eventually grow to take in all the Elemental Realms. the realms of Light and Dark magic, however, are beyond their grasp. Archers can focus themselves to become Battle Mages (gaining one hit point and one spell point per level), and eventually may aspire to Warrior Mages (gaining another hit point and spell point per level).</li><li><strong>Druids </strong>combine the best of Sorcerer and Cleric classes. They have few hit points, and make poor fighters; their arsenal is limited to staff, dagger, and bow, and their armor is restricted to leather and shield. On the plus side, they can build a heck of a circle or rocks, and can use both Sorcerer and Clerical magic: that unique mix allows them to cast certain spells no other class can. They cannot, however, learn Light and Dark magic. To make up for that, Druids may begin their Apprenticeships with the Learning skill. A Druid can grow to become a Great Druid (gaining one hit point and one spell point per level) and eventually to an Arch Druid (gaining another spell point and another hit point per level).</li></ul><h3>Skills</h3><h4>Weapon skills</h4><ul><li><b>Staffs</b> are two-handed poles equally good for offense and defense. Expert ranking with the staff will increase the character's armor class and Master ranking will allow them to occasionally stun their opponents.</li><li><b>Sword</b> skill covers most types of blades longer than a knife. Expert swordsmen gain a quicker attack while Master swordsmen may wield any one-handed sword in their left hand and another weapon in their right.</li><li><b>Daggers</b> don't do the kind of damage that a sword or an axe can deliver, but their quick attacks can sometimes let a character get in two slices for every one move made by a slower opponent. Expert dagger fighters can wield a dagger in their left hand while using another weapon in their right. Master dagger fighters have a chance of killing a surprised opponent with a single blow.</li><li><b>Axes</b> are rather slow on the attack, but do a lot of damage when they hit. Expert axe fighters gain more speed in their attacks while Master axe fighters can deliver tremendous damage.</li><li><b>Spears</b> make their point by including all pole weapons with blades attached to the business end. Versatile, they can be used one- or two-handed, but they work better with two hands. Expert ranking with the spear will increase a character's armor class, and Master ranking will boost damage caused.</li><li><b>Bow</b> skill targets both bows and crossbows. Expert marksmen gain a speed increase with their weapon, while Masters fire two arrows with every attack.</li><li><b>Mace</b> skill covers all blunt trauma weapons: batons, flails, the general whack-in-the-head arsenal. Expert mace swingers do extra damage with their weapons, while Masters can stun opponents.</li></ul><h4>Armor Skills</h4><p>Note: all armor types (not counting shield) carry a penalty by slowing down a character; Master and Expert kill in armor reduces this drag.</p><ul><li><b>Leather</b> armor is the lightest armor available. Providing less protection than chain or plate armor, it also slows a character down the least.</li><li><b>Chain</b> armor provides more protection than leather and less than plate; thus, it also slows a character down more than leather.</li><li><b>Plate</b> armor delivers the most value for money, affording the most protection, but also the greatest reduction in speed.</li><li><b>Shield</b> skill directly improves a character's armor class while a shield is equipped. Expert and Master shield ranking increase this defensive bonus.</li></ul><h4>Magic Skills</h4><p>Note: Expert and Master ranks in the various Magic skills have different effects for each individual spell of that Magic school.</p><ul><li><b>Fire</b> magic is a good way to burn a bad guy, and also includes speed and pain spells.</li><li><b>Air</b> magic tends to be defensive and informational in nature, and includes spells of accuracy and flight.</li><li><b>Water</b> magic is equally useful for defense and offense, and concentrates on spells that move or change things.</li><li><b>Earth</b> magic is defensive and includes spells that protect, bind, and strengthen.</li><li><b>Spirit </b>magic concentrates on spells of life and death. Live forever, bring back the dead, slow or accelerate aging.</li><li><b>Body</b> magic cures disease, dissolves poisons, and generally heals and enchants.</li><li><b>Mind</b> magic charms and confuses.</li><li><b>Light</b> magic includes some of the strongest spells in the land. However, Light magic cannot be chosen by beginning characters and must be learned and mastered during the player's travels.</li><li><b>Dark</b> magic, as with Light above, comprises some of the most powerful magic in Enroth. Spells of darkness can have spectacular results, but generally carry a price. As above, Dark magic cannot be chosen by beginning characters, and must be gathered and invoked during the party's travels.</li></ul><h4>Miscellaneous Skills</h4><ul><li><b>Identify</b> gives meaning to items and equipment; an item can't be used until it's been identified. This skill will automatically identify an item, depending on the party member's skill level. Special items may need an Expert or Master in this skill to properly identify them.</li><li><b>Merchant</b> skill helps adjust prices in the party's favor, whether buying or selling. Remember: buy low, sell high.</li><li><b>Repair</b> skill allows characters to fix broken equipment. The higher the skill level, the better the quality of item the character can play handyman on. Expert and master rankings allow characters to repair complex items and artifacts.</li><li><b>Bodybuilding</b> skill pumps the party member up, adding hit points directly to totals.</li><li><b>Meditation</b> adds spell points directly to the relaxed character's totals.</li><li><b>Perception</b> sharpens the character's chance of noticing a trap: catch it in time, and the damage it causes can be reduced or even avoided. A higher perception skill equals a chance to escape stronger escapes; Expert and Master rankings allow a character to notice and escape different types of traps.</li><li><b>Diplomacy</b> is like having a politician in the party! It alters the party's reputation in its favor. Have a 10 skill ranking in Diplomacy? Talk to a nobleman, and reputation goes up by 10; talk to a goblin, and it goes down by 10. The character fits in everywhere!</li><li><b>Disarm Trap</b> skill ensures that the player won't be caught by a trap upon opening a chest. The more skill the party member has, the better the character's chance to disarm any trap before it goes off.</li><li><b>Learning</b> skill increases the experience the character receives. Every rank of skill increases the experience bonus the character earns; experts double and Masters triple this bonus.</li></ul><h3>Spells</h3><p>Each of the various schools of magic have their own unique spells. Spells can have all types of wildly varying effects, from simply lighting a dark hallway to calling down a cataclysmic storm of meteors on everybody in the vicinity! Here is a list of all the spells arranged by school, with descriptions of their effects and the bonus gained from Expert and Master ranking in the relevant Magic skill.</p><h4>Fire Spells</h4><ul><li><b>Torch Light</b> produces a sphere of light around the party, though this only works indoors. Use it for those dark caverns where the shadows conceal dangers! It costs one spell point to cast. Expect it to last one hour times an adventurer's skill rank. At Expert and Master levels, the light produced is noticeably brighter. An essential spell!</li><li><b>Flame Arrow</b> fires a single flaming arrow. Don't be taken in by the power of fire; this spell is notoriously inaccurate, with no more chance of finding its target than a regular arrow. It costs two spell points to cast, and the character must recover her energy before she can use it again. It works instantaneously, and will do between one and eight points of damage, assuming it hits anything! At Expert level, Flame Arrow costs just one point, and can be used again more quickly; Masters recover more quickly and fire without cost, making it a bargain!</li><li><b>Protection from Fire</b> increases all characters' resistance to fire: one point of resistance for every rank of the caster's Fire Magic skill. The cost is three points and the caster must recover. The effects last for one hour per skill rank. Experts double the resistance, while Masters triple it.</li><li><b>Fire Bolt</b> launches a burst of fire at a single target. Costing four points, it takes a while to rebuild strength to launch again. It fires immediately, and will deliver between one and four points of damage multiplied by a character's skill rank. Experts are ready to fire again more quickly, while Masters recover even faster.</li><li><b>Haste</b> reduces the time it takes to recover from casting a spell or attacking with a weapon by 25 seconds. Beware, for characters will be weak for six hours after this spell wears off. It costs five points to cast, and requires recovery. It lasts for four minutes plus one additional minute for every skill rank of the character. Experts reduce the recovery time, while a Master's spell affects the entire party.</li><li><b>Fireball</b> targets a single monster, but explodes to hurt anyone else caught in the blast. Entertaining, but dangerous! Keep the party at a distance; if they stand too close, they will share the damage. This one costs eight spell points, and takes some time to recover. It takes place instantaneously, and delivers between one and six points of damage times a character's skill rank to all within a 10 foot radius. An Expert's recovery time is faster, while a Master's is faster still.</li><li><b>Ring of Fire</b> gfnerates a five-foot ring of fire around the party, damaging all monsters that dare approach it, doing no harm to the party itself. Its costs 10 points with a significant recovery time. Its effect is immediate, and it causes six points of damage plus one additional damage point for every skill rank. Experts conjure a 10-foot ring, while Masters' recovery time is significantly reduced.</li><li><b>Fire Blast</b> launches streaks of fire in the direction the characters are facing. The bolts aren't magically guided, so a little practice aiming is called for to ensure accuracy! Cost is 15 spell points, and the caster must rest afterwords. It fires three bolts instantly, delivering four points of damage plus an additional one to three points of damage for each skill rank. Experts need less rest and discharge five shots; Masters rest even less and launch seven shots.</li><li><b>Meteor Shower</b> summons eight flaming rocks from the sky in a 10-foot radius surrounding a target. Try not to be near the victim when using this spell. Cost is 20 points with a period necessary to recoup energy. The shower is instant, and each rock delivers eight points of damage plus one additional for every skill rank. Experts recover faster and bring down 12 rocks; Masters are ready again more quickly with 16 rocks. This spell cannot be cast indoors, thank the gods!</li><li><b>Inferno</b> burns all monsters in sight; though the party is excluded from the cookout. An efficient way to clean out rooms full of monsters of weak or moderate strength in one or two easy castings. Cost to the character is just 25 spell points, though recovery time is significant. The Inferno deals 12 points of damage with an additional point of damage for every skill rank. Experts' recovery time is cut somewhat, while Masters take just a quick breather between spells.</li><li><b>Incinerate</b> is one of the strongest direct damage spells that can be acquired, inflicting massive damage on a single target. Only the strongest of monsters can expect to survive this spell. Spell point cost is 30, and recovery is necessary. As with Inferno, this spell casts instantly, searing 15 points of damage, plus one to 15 points extra for each rank of the caster's skill. Experts recover more quickly, Masters faster still.</li></ul><h4>Air Spells</h4><ul><li><b>Wizard Eye</b> reveals the locations of monsters and characters on the automap. It lasts for one hour and it costs one spell point to cast. Experts and Masters will learn more on casting this spell than an Apprentice.</li><li><b>Static Charge</b> targets a single monster with a jolt of static electricity. While it doesn't administer much damage, it never misses. At a two-point cost, Static Charge is a tiring spell, requiring rest. It fires instantly, dealing one point of damage, plus an additional one to five points of damage for every skill rank. Experts are ready to go again more quickly, Masters fire at no cost.</li><li><b>Protection from Electricity</b> increases all characters' resistance to electricity: one point of resistance for every rank of the caster's Air magic skill. The spell comes in an at a three-point price tag with recovery. The protection lasts one hour per skill rank; Experts double the resistance, while Masters triple it.</li><li><b>Sparks</b> fires three small balls of lightning that bounce around until they hit something or dissipate. It's hard to tell where they will go, so this spell is best used in a room crowded with small monsters, and with most of the party elsewhere. The spell costs four points with each sparks dealing twp points of damage, plus one additional point per skill rank. Experts recover more quickly, and fire five sparks, while Masters are ready to go again even faster, with seven shots.</li><li><b>Feather Fall</b> slows the speed of a fall and prevents the party from damage when falling more than 10 feet. The cost for this spell is five points, and recovery takes time. It lasts for five minutes for every Air magic skill rank. Experts get the duration up to 10 minutes per skill rank, while Masters rate one hour per skill rank.</li><li><b>Shield</b> slows missile attacks (such as rocks and arrows) and cuts their potential damage by half. A Shield costs eight spell points, though use it wisely, as it takes time to recover. It lasts five minutes for every skill rank; Experts' Shields last 15 minutes per skill rank, while a Master's version affects the entire party.</li><li><b>Lightning Bolt</b> discharges electricity instantly from the caster's hand to a single target. It always hits and does solid damage at one to eight points for each skill rank. It costs 10 spell points. Experts recover more quickly, while Masters are ready again faster still.</li><li><b>Jump</b> launches the party into the air at a 45 degree angle, landing them without damage a set distance away. It costs the caster only 15 spell points and higher skill will reduce recovery time. Experts and Masters recover more quickly.</li><li><b>Implosion</b> is a nasty spell that affects a single target by destroying the air around it. The result is a sudden inrush from the surrounding air, a thunderclap, and 10 points of damage plus an extra one to 10 points of damage for every skill rank. It costs 20 points to cast, and rest is required; Experts are back to readiness more quickly, Masters faster still.</li><li><b>Fly</b> grants the power of flight to the characters at five minutes airborne for every skill rank! Only available outdoors, Fly initially costs 25 spell points and slowly drains spell points as it remains active. Be careful not to fall from a great height as fall damage still applies. Experts can stay up for 10 minutes per skill rank, while Masters wing it for an entire hour per skill rank.</li><li><b>Starburst</b> calls eight stars from the heavens to smite and burn the party's enemies in a 20-foot radius. Try not to get caught in the blast! Cost is 30 spell points, and recovery is significant. Each star deals 20 points of damage plus an extra point of for every skill rank. Experts reduce their recovery somewhat and can call down 12 stars; Masters turn back their recovery even more, delivering 16 stars. The spell only functions outdoors.</li></ul><h4>Water Spells</h4><ul><li><b>Awaken</b> automatically draws the party from a normal sleep and dramatically reduces the duration of sleep spells cast on them. The spells costs one point, and some recovery is required. Awaken will remove three minutes of sleep times the caster's skill rank; Experts' skill rank multiply the effect by hours, while Masters multiply it by days.</li><li><b>Cold Beam</b> targets a single monster with a field of extreme cold for instant, though not significant, damage. Bringing the pain at only between two to six points of damage, this spell always hits at a cost of two spell points. Recovery is required, but with every advance in skill this becomes less of a problem. Experts recover faster, and Masters cast without cost. Now that's an education that pays off!</li><li><b>Protection from Cold</b> increases all the characters' resistance to Cold by one point of resistance for every rank the caster holds in Water magic. At a three-point cost, with required recovery, the protection lasts for one hour per skill rank. Experts double the resistance, while Masters triple it.</li><li><b>Poison Spray</b> sprays one shot of poison at monsters directly in front of the party. While the damage is low (two points plus one to two points for every skill rank), few monsters have resistance to poison, so it's an easy way to make 'em suffer. The spell costs four points, and recovery is required. Experts recover more quickly and fire three shots, while Masters are back at it faster with five shots.</li><li><b>Water Walk</b> lets the party traverse the surface of water without sinking for five minutes for every skill rank. Only useful outdoors, this spell costs five points initially, and constantly drains spell points while active. Experts stay topside for 10 minutes for every skill rank, while Masters are afloat for one hour per skill ranking. The spell drain is the same no matter what the level of the caster.</li><li><b>Ice Bolt</b> fires a single bolt of ice at a single target for a guaranteed hit of moderate cold damage, between one and seven points per skill rank. The spell costs 8, and Experts and Masters recover more quickly.</li><li><b>Enchant Item</b> will attempt to make an ordinary item magical. The chance of success increases with the caster's skill in Water magic. Unless the caster is a Master, weapons cannot be enchanted. With a 10-point cost to cast, know that Experts make better magic items.</li><li><b>Acid Burst</b> targets a single monster with an acidic bolt that does nine points of damage plus one to nine points per skill rank in Water magic. The spell costs 15 points to cast and Experts and Masters will recover faster.</li><li><b>Town Portal</b> transports the party to the last town they visited. At Apprentice level it only works outdoors. Exercise caution, as the chance of Town Portal working is rather small, though improved by the caster's rank in Water magic. At a 25-point cost, recovery is slow. Experts can use this spell indoors, and Masters can choose the town.</li><li><b>Ice Blast</b> fires a ball of ice in the direction the caster is facing. The ball will shatter when it hits something, launching seven shards of ice in all directions, except the caster's. Shards ricochet until they strike a creature (or melt) dealing 12 points of damage plus one to two points per rank of Water magic skill. Beware that the ricochet can hit the party, even when the shards don't start out in their direction. It costs 25 points, and requires recovery time, which is less for Experts and Masters.</li><li><b>Lloyd's Beacon</b> lets the player place one marker at a location to which they wish to teleport back in the future. Just how far in the future depends on the caster's skill and ranking in Water magic; the marker decays in one hour times a character's skill rank.

Experts can establish up to three beacons, which decay in one day per skill rank, while Masters are armed with five beacons, which decay in one week per skill rank.</li></ul><h4>Earth Spells</h4><ul><li><b>Stun</b> slaps a monster with magical force, leaving the creature to recover from the spell before it can do anything else. It also knocks monsters back a little, giving the party a chance to get away while the getting is good. The spell costs one point and some recovery is required. In effect, Stun adds to a monster's recovery time, with somewhat greater effect for every skill rank of the caster. Experts and Masters are both more effective.</li><li><b>Magic Arrow</b> fires a single magic arrow. This spell is notoriously inaccurate and has no more chance of finding its target than a regular arrow. It costs two spell points to cast, and some time needs to pass before it can be used again. It will do two points of damage (assuming it hits anything!), with an extra one to six damage points for every skill rank. At Expert level, the cost is just one point, and recovery time is faster; Masters can fire again more quickly and without cost.</li><li><b>Protection from Magic </b>increases all the characters' resistance to magic by one point for every rank of the caster's Earth magic skill. The spells costs three points and recovery is required. The Protection lasts for one hour per skill rank. Experts double this resistance, while Masters triple it.</li><li><b>Deadly Swarm</b> summons a swarm of biting, stinging insects to bedevil a single target.

Spell point cost is 4, and, as usual, Experts and Masters recover more quickly.</li><li><b>Stone Skin</b> increases the armor class of a character by five for four minutes, plus an extra five minutes for every skill rank. The cost to cast is five. Experts up the time limit to an extra 15 minutes for every skill rank, while Masters extend the power to affect the entire party.</li><li><b>Blades</b> fires a rotating, razor-thin metal blade at a single monster.

The Blades does between one and five damage points for every skill rank. Experts and Masters recover more quickly.</li><li><b>Stone to Flesh</b>, if cast in time, removes the curse of being turned to stone from a character. The caster's skill and rank in Earth magic (skill rank times three minutes of stone duration with Experts taking that time to hours and Masters to days) determine how long the dire condition can be present before the spell loses its effectiveness. After that, the only way to remove the condition short of Divine Intervention is to visit a temple. Stone to Flesh costs 10 spell points.</li><li><b>Rock Blast </b>releases a magical stone into the world that will explode either when it comes into contact with a creature or when enough time passes, causing damage in a radius of 20 feet. The rock will bounce and roll until it finds a resting spot. Be careful, though, as anyone can be caught in the blast. This spell costs 15 points, and needs time to recover. Its damage is between one and eight points per skill rank. Experts recover more quickly, while Masters are able to fire again faster.</li><li><b>Turn to Stone</b>, as the name suggests, temporarily turns a target to stone for five minutes for every skill rank.

Some recovery required.</li><li><b>Death Blossom</b> fires a magical stone far into the air, causing a very powerful explosion with a radius of 40 feet when it lands. This spell costs 25 points and requiring time to recover. Damage is 20 points, with an extra point for every skill rank.

This spell is for the open countryside, not indoors in a living room parlor.</li><li><b>Mass Distortion</b> increases the weight of a single target enormously for an instant, causing significant internal damage equal to 25% of the monster's hit points plus another 2% per rank of Earth magic skill. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Spell point cost is 30, and is very tiring, though Experts and Masters recover more quickly.</li></ul><h4>Spirit Spells</h4><ul><li><b>Spirit Arrow</b> launches an arrow of pure energy. Though highly useful, this spell is apt to miss unless the caster has a Spirit skill to an adequate level. It costs one spell point to cast, and it has a moderate cooldown period.

At t Expert level, the recovery will be faster, while at Master level, it can be cast at no cost.</li><li><b>Bless</b> characters to increase their chance of hitting monsters in hand-to-hand combat and with missile weapons. A character's bonus to hit is increased by five, which lasts for four minutes, plus an extra five minutes for every skill rank. The cost to cast this blessing is two spell points. The duration for Expert casters is an extra 15 minutes for every skill rank; Masters casting this spell affect all characters at once.</li><li><b>Healing Touch</b> heals a single character, restoring a small number of hit points, between three and seven, based on skill. At a three-point cost to cast, recovery is moderate, but each skill rank will reduce that time. An Expert's healing mends five to 11 hit points, while a Master bandages seven to 13.</li><li><b>Lucky Day</b> temporarily increases a single character's Luck statistic by 10, plus an extra two for every skill rank.

Masters spread the luck around to all the characters in the party.</li><li><b>Remove Curse</b>, as its name suggests and if cast in time, removes a curse from a character. The caster's skill and rank (skill rank multiplied by three minutes of having been cursed, multiplied by hours for Experts and days for Masters) in Spirit magic determine how long the dread condition can be present before the point of no return. After that, the only way to remove the condition short of Divine Intervention is to visit a temple. Remove Curse's casting cost is 10, and time is required to recover.</li><li><b>Guardian Angel</b> sets up a pact with the Higher Powers to resurrect characters. Should they die, they'll be returned to life with one hit point and deposited at the last temple visited. The price for this service is half of the gold the characters have with them at the time of death. The spell costs eight points, and recovery time is significant. Experts bring back all characters at half their hit points at time of death. Masters arrange it so all characters return with full hit points. The cost in gold doesn't change.</li><li><b>Heroism</b> increases by five the damage that a character does with a successful attack. This costs 10 spell points, and the caster must rest; it lasts for four minutes, with an extra five minutes for every skill rank. Experts get an extra 15 minutes for every skill rank, while Masters affect all the characters in the party.</li><li><b>Turn Undead</b> forces all undead monsters in sight of the caster to flee. They'll be back when the spell runs out in three minutes, plus an extra three minutes for every skill rank. Cost for this scattering is 15. Experts and Masters will recover faster.</li><li><b>Raise Dead</b>, if cast in time, restores a character to life. The caster's skill and rank in Spirit magic determine how long the character can be worm food before the point of no return (skill rank multiplied by three minutes of death, by one hour for Experts and by days for Masters). After that, the only way to revive the corpse, short of Divine Intervention, is to visit a temple. Raise Dead costs 20 spell points. This magic will leave a character in a weak condition for a full day.</li><li><b>Shared Life</b> combines the life force of the characters and redistributes it between them as evenly as possible. All current hit points are totaled, and one extra hit point is added for every skill rank. The cost for this spell averages 25, and the recovery time is very significant.

This will last for one hour for every skill rank and carries a cost of one spell point.

Cure Paralysis costs five spell points to cast, and requires recovery.</li><li><b>Charm</b> calms a single targeted creature and removes any hostile feelings it has towards the party, an effect that lasts three minutes for every skill rank.

Experts will double the effect's duration, while Masters quadruple it.</li><li><b>Mass Fear</b> causes all creatures in the caster's line of sight to flee in fear, a cowardly condition lasting three minutes for every skill rank.

Experts and Masters recover more quickly than Apprentices.</li><li><b>Feeblemind</b> removes the ability of a target to cast spells until Feeblemind wears off; it lasts five minutes per each skill rank of the caster.

Experts cast the block of spells at three times Light magic skill; Masters make it happen at four times.</li><li><b>Paralyze</b> disables a monster for one minute for every skill rankings. Paralyzed monsters may be freely attacked without fear of reprisal. Not fair, perhaps, but satisfying. It costs 60 spell points to launch; recovery is moderate. Experts and Masters will recover faster.</li><li><b>Sunray</b> is the second most devastating spell a party may acquire. Harnessing the light of the sun and concentrating it on one pathetic creature, Sunray unleashes 20 points of damage, with an additional one to 20 points for every skill rank.

Experts can call upon Divine Intervention twice per day, Masters three times.</li></ul><h4>Dark Spells</h4><ul><li><b>Reanimate</b> will allow the caster to \"raise from the dead\" any monster or NPC, depending on their original hit points and the caster's skill in Dark magic.

Experts and Masters can reanimate corpses with higher hit points.</li><li><b>Toxic Cloud</b> creates a poisonous cloud of noxious gases in front of the caster and sends it slowly away from the characters, dealing out 25 points of damage, plus an extra one to 10 points per skill rank.

Apprentices will reduce a creature to one half of its normal size, and this shrunken monster will only deal out one half its normal damage. This effect lasts for five minutes per rank of the caster's skill, and carries a cost of 60. Experts shrink monsters by two-thirds (both size and damage), while Masters quarter a beast's size and damage.</li><li><b>Day of Protection</b> simultaneously casts Protection from Fire, Electricity, Cold, Poison, and Magic on all the characters, plus Feather Fall and Wizard Eye. The statistics added equal to two times the caster's skill rank. This spell costs 70 spell points, and lasts for one day. Experts add three times the caster's skill rank, while Masters add four times in statistic increase.</li><li><b>Finger of Death</b> attempts to immediately slay a single creature by stripping its soul from its body. Charming. Finger of Death has a 3% chance per skill rank in Dark magic of working. It costs 80 spell points to cast, and recovery time is moderate. Experts chances increased to 4%; Masters improve their odds all the way up to 5%.</li><li><b>Moon Ray</b> heals characters and damages all monsters in sight. For every skill rank, this spell delivers one to four points of damage to enemies, and restores an equal number of hit points to all characters in the party. This is the only spell that harms all monsters in sight and aids the party. Moon Ray is restricted to working outdoors and in the moonlight, at a cost of 90 spell points. Recovery is required, though less for Experts and Masters.</li><li><b>Dragon Breath</b> is the most powerful damaging spell in the game. It empowers the caster to exhale a cloud of toxic vapors that targets a single monster, but also damages all other creatures within a 10-foot radius. It costs 100 spell points, delivering one to25 points of damage for every skill rank. Recovery time is significant, but less for Experts and Masters.</li><li><b>Armageddon</b> is the town killer, inflicting 50 points of damage plus one point of damage for every rank of Dark skill the character has to every creature on the map, including the party itself. It can only be cast once per day, and only outdoors, without cost in spell points. Quite exhausting, really. Experts can use Armageddon twice per day, while Masters can unleash it three times in one 24-hour period.</li><li><b>Dark Containment</b> is a powerful and mysterious spell. Even the great wizard Klavis Verge has only glimpsed it but once. Learning its secrets is not for the weak, nor the faint of heart.</li></ul><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886039\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6952380952381\" data-width=\"420\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 420px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886039\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg 420w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg 420w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/886039-hommvi03.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Battle is in real-time although a turn-based approach to fighting the enemy can also be activated allowing for a pause after every action. Each character moves at their own individual pace. After their initial action, a short amount of time must pass before they are ready to strike the enemy or cast another spell. Various factors affect their recovery speed, such as whether the party is moving onscreen or if they are simply inherently slower due to their statistics.</p><p>Equipping characters is easily done from the inventory screen, which shows both what is in their individual pack and what is on their \"doll\" as represented on the right of the screen, similar to the paper doll system utilized by <a href=\"/ultima-vii-the-black-gate/3030-230/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-230\">Ultima VII</a>. Depending on a character's skill set, dual-wielding is possible allowing a Master Swordsman to wield two blades at once.</p><p>The use of missile weapons in the game, which range from simple bows and arrows to futuristic blasters, coupled with the real-time combat system can give the later game the impression of being a crude FPS thanks to the fact that enemies are always visible onscreen.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Ys Origin is an action RPG developed by <a href=\"/nihon-falcom-corp/3010-849/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-849\">Nihon Falcom</a> for the PC and was released on December 21, 2006. The game is a prequel to <a href=\"/ys-the-vanished-omens/3030-14318/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14318\">Ancient Ys Vanished</a> and is the first entry in the <a href=\"/ys/3025-112/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-112\">Ys</a> series' timeline. Ys Origin was originally translated into English by a group of Italian hackers called <a href=\"http://www.figlidigaucci.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Figli di Gaucci Production</a> who released an <a href=\"http://www.figlidigaucci.eu/index.php?pid=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">English patch</a> for the game on September 27, 2011. Ys Origin was released on Steam by <a href=\"/xseed-games/3010-3540/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3540\">XSEED</a> on May 31, 2012 which used a modified version of Figli di Graucci's translation in the official release.</p><p> </p><h2>Story</h2><p>Ys, the land that once was prosperous, ruled by the Goddesses' Reah and Feena and their loyal six priests. It was the perfect place for everyone, they can perform magic thanks to the power granted to them by the holy artifact known as the Black Pearl.</p><p>One day demons and monsters invaded the land without any warning, bringing death and destruction in their wake. The numbers of the demons and monsters outnumbered the knights and sorcerers of Ys to fend off, so the people of Ys sought shelter within the holy temples at the top of the tallest mountain. In a desperate attempt to provide a safety to the people, the Goddesses used the power of the Black Pearl to raise the temple off the ground and raise it to the heavens away from the madness below.</p><p>The demons were determined to bring down Ys, so they erected a very tall tower to launch further attack on Ys. With forces from Ys fighting the demons below, an all-out war has broke out.</p><p>During all the chaos, the twin Goddesses disappeared into the night. No one was told of their departure and even the six priests did not know. With all the madness going on, it was clear that they have returned to the surface. Why did they go back to the surface? No one knows why. Ys is in need of the twin Goddesses or else hope is lost for the people.</p><p>With the missing Goddesses, the six priests organized a search party of elite knights and sorcerers in Ys. The mission was: Secure the safety of the twin Goddesses and bring them back alive and well.</p><p>Of all the places they could be in the remains of Ys, it could only be The Devil's Tower.</p><p> </p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><b><a href=\"/yunica-tovah/3005-25684/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25684\">Yunica Tovah</a>:</b> Yunica is a descedent of Priest Tovah. She is one of many groups that are responsible for looking into the disappearance of the two goddesses. Yunica plays pretty much like <a href=\"/adol-christin/3005-2477/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2477\">Adol Christin</a> in almost every way except that she uses an axe instead of a sword.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"/hugo-fact/3005-25685/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25685\">Hugo Fact</a>:</b> Hugo is a descendent of Priest Fact. He is a magician that uses magic projectiles as his weapon and he also controls floating orbs that gives him extra power for more projectiles called The Eyes of Fact. Unlike Yunica, Hugo can't attack with melee weapons but he uses magic to shoot the enemies. He is pretty much a run and gun character.</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-claw/3005-25686/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25686\">The Claw</a>:</b> The Claw is a character that is shrouded in mystery. No one knows who or what is objective is. The Claw is also known as one of the worst kept secret character in the game.</li></ul><h2>System Requirements</h2><p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>OS :</strong> XP</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Pentium III / 1 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>64 MB VRAM, 3D accelerator compatible w/ DirectX 9.0c</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>2 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Compatible with DirectX 9.0c</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong>XP, Vista, 7, 64-bit compatible</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>Pentium4 / 1.3 GHz or higher</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>1 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>64 MB VRAM, 3D accelerator compatible w/ DirectX 9.0c</li><li><strong>DirectX®:</strong>9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong>2 GB HD space</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong>Compatible with DirectX 9.0c</li></ul></li></ul>",

The game features several characters from the cartoon, including Buster, Plucky, Babs, Dizzy and Hampton J. Pig. The player assumes the role of Buster Bunny. As Buster, the player can dash and jump through six stages based off of episodes from the TV show. These stages include the halls of ACME University, catching a ride on a wild train, jumping though the skies, play the last hope for ACME University football team, exploring a haunted mansion and battling it out in space.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The game has variable levels of difficulty which change the number of lives, heart containers (health) and continues the player begins with. The easiest setting, Children, allows the player to continue as often as they'd like, but also removes a lot of the game's content including its ending and the entire sky stage (Stage 5). After each stage, the player spins a wheel to determine which of five bonus games they are to play for a chance to earn some extra lives.</span></span></p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Firemen is set in the near future of 2010, where civilization has lost much of its will to progress further technologically and is in a state of stagnation which has lasted 20 years. The setting is the Metrotech Chemical Company building, based in <a href=\"/new-york/3035-3656/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3656\">New York</a>, which is celebrating their annual <a href=\"/christmas/3015-6522/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6522\">Christmas</a> party when a small fire begins in the kitchen of the building and quickly grows in strength due to the abundance of chemicals surrounding it.</p><p>D-Sector Firemen, Pete and Daniel, are immediately dispatched to the burning building to tackle the rapidly spreading fire. They are supported from outside the building by Max, Walter and Winona, who advise them on their situation and analyse the dangers from afar using hi-tech surveillance technology. Together, they work together to extract the most dangerous chemical, MDL, from the basement of the ablaze building and must take it to the roof before the flames reach it, potentially causing a huge explosion.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119151-4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119151\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119151-4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119151\"><img alt=\"I'm sure he's fine\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119151-4.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119151-4.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>I'm sure he's fine</figcaption></figure><p>The Firemen has a distinctive gameplay system that is reminiscent of more recent games such as <a href=\"/super-mario-sunshine/3030-6649/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6649\">Mario Sunshine</a>. The player's firefighter is equipped with a water cannon backpack, and can adjust their water stream from long-distance stream to short-distance spray. It is necessary to use each of these different settings, as the firefighters are surrounded at all times by fire, and there are bonuses for clearing a level entirely of any flames. The player must also top up their water levels by moving to a water source and refilling the tank. In addition to the tank, there's a supply of water bombs, which clear the screen of any fire. These are limited to two or three, however, and are difficult to find.</p><p>As Pete and Daniel move from room to room within the Macrotech Building, they encounter unconscious employees. They must clear an area of fire before the employee will awaken and move to safety, and this gets gradually more difficult as the game goes on. Also, as well as the constant threat of fire, there are malfunctioning cleaning robots and other machinery, which will strive to harm the firefighters. Traditional end-of-level bosses are also included, and usually come in the form of \"bigger\" fires with weak spots and clear attack patterns.</p><h2>Limited Release and Sequel</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119159-box.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119159\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0135135135135\" data-width=\"296\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 296px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119159-box.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119159\"><img alt=\"The Firemen 2\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119159-box.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2119159-box.png 296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" data-width=\"296\"></a><figcaption>The Firemen 2</figcaption></figure><p>The Firemen is unusual, as it was only released in Japan and Europe officially, with the US missing out on release entirely.

The game is very similar to a lot of the other colorful character-driven platformers of its era, but it distinguished itself with its unique limb-throwing play mechanic and punishing difficulty.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/508945-plok__u__00000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-508945\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/508945-plok__u__00000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-508945\"><img alt=\"The eponymous Plok.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/508945-plok__u__00000.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/508945-plok__u__00000.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The eponymous Plok.</figcaption></figure><p>The game opens with <a href=\"/plok/3005-1825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1825\">Plok</a>, king of the island of Akrillic in the Poly-Esta archipelago, waking up to discover that his Grandpappy’s flag which flew proudly over his home has been stolen. Spotting his flag flying on the nearby Cotton Island, Plok sets sail to retrieve it. Once on Cotton Island, Plok makes his way through a series of decoy flags before finally defeating the Bobbins Brothers and retrieving his family heirloom.</p><p>Upon his return home, Plok discovers that the theft of his Grandpappy’s flag was simply for the purpose of luring him away from Akrillic so that it would be left defenseless for the Fleas to take over and raise their flags over the land in the place of Plok’s. Determined to reclaim his island, Plok sets out to rid the island of the Fleas and their allies. His quest eventually takes him to the depths of the Flea Pit where he must face off against the Flea Queen in order to determine the fate of Akrillic.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/509113-plok__u__00011.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-509113\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/509113-plok__u__00011.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-509113\"><img alt=\"Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/509113-plok__u__00011.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2840/509113-plok__u__00011.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.</figcaption></figure><p>Plok’s primary ability is that he is able to throw his arms and legs in a boomerang-like manner. This ability can be used both as an attack and to solve certain puzzles which involve Plok giving up a limb in order to activate a switch. With fewer limbs, Plok is less mobile and has less “ammunition” to attack with. Limbs used to activate switches can be retrieved from a hanger somewhere else in the level. Plok is also able to perform a spinning high-jump (very similar to <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>’s jumps) which allows him to reach platforms he can’t with his weak standard jump. After receiving an amulet later in the game, the high-jump can also be used as an attack.</p><p>Plok proceeds from level to level via an overworld screen. The path is linear, but levels can be skipped by using warps throughout the game. Warp zones are accessed by hitting specific berries (usually just used to increase health) until they teleport Plok to the warp area. Once in the warp zone, a “Race Against Time” event will take place which challenges Plok to get some sort of vehicle through a special level and across the finish line in a limited amount of time. If Plok is successful, he’ll be transported ahead to a later level of the game, but if he fails, he’ll be spit back out in the same spot he entered the warp zone.</p><p>The world of Poly-Esta is filled with many different items and power-ups for Plok to collect. Shells scattered throughout each level will net him an extra life if he can get enough. They can also be used to fuel his special high-jump attack after the amulet item is received later in the game. Additionally, Plok collects the letters P-L-O-K in order to get “Plokontinues” which allow him to continue his journey if he loses all of his lives. Every time Plok defeats a Rockyfella, it will drop a ruby which grants Plok invincibility for a short time. The Razor Wheel pickup will transform Plok into an invincible spinning steel blade that storms through the world with incredible speed. Presents hidden in the world allow Plok to temporarily don one of many costumes that grant him special abilities.</p><h2>Development History</h2><p>The character of <a href=\"/plok/3005-1825/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1825\">Plok</a> was originally developed during the late 80’s by brothers <a href=\"/john-pickford/3040-36037/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-36037\">John Pickford</a> and <a href=\"/ste-pickford/3040-4787/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4787\">Ste Pickford</a>. The character’s introduction to the public was to be as the star of a <a href=\"/zippo-games/3010-1634/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1634\">Zippo Games</a> developed coin-op game titled Fleapit, but unfortunately after the game was about half complete it was put on hold and eventually disappeared with the closing of the studio. The Pickford brothers however managed to retain the intellectual property rights to the basic game and character design. This allowed them to commence with development of another similar title that would eventually become the 1993 title Plok.</p><h2>Game Reception</h2><p>When the Pickford brothers were first developing Fleapit (the game that would become Plok) during the late 80’s, the gaming landscape was ripe for an inventive, cute, colorful, character-driven platformer to come along and explode with popularity. However, during the early 90’s the video game market experienced a massive flood of colorful character-driven platform titles such as <a href=\"/bubsy-in-claws-encounters-of-the-furred-kind/3030-20205/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20205\">Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</a>, <a href=\"/rayman/3030-18473/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18473\">Rayman</a>, <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, and <a href=\"/zool/3030-8884/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8884\">Zool</a>. Thus, by the time Plok was finally released in 1993, it didn’t seem nearly as fresh as it was when development first started nearly five years ago. Reviews for the game were overall very favorable, but commercially the game was received very poorly and sales were underwhelming. There just wasn’t enough to distinguish this game from all of the others that appeared so similar. The game has also at times been criticized because of its difficulty and lack of a save or password system.</p><p>Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,8,9 and 8 with \"Sushi-X\" exclaiming, \"...Plok has got to be one of the most unique games to come out in a while.\" Ed Semrad wrote, \"...while the bosses aren't anything to write home about, the actual game is visually stunning. The challenge level is really high, possibly turning off younger players, but hard-core gamers will love it\".</p>",

Teamed up they make a force to be reckoned with. However where there are good guys there is always a bad guy and it comes in the form of <a href=\"/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3237\">Chairman Drek</a>. A creepy space alien who wants to take over the universe and that's what Ratchet and Clank are here to prevent.</p><p>Ratchet and Clank is a platformer game with an emphasis on varied and slapstick weaponry, and levels filled with a variety of aliens and robots for Ratchet and Clank to defeat with whatever they have available. Players can attack, dodge, blast and tactically jump their way into and out of any situation with an array of crazy weapons at their disposal.</p><p>There are near limitless ways to dispose of enemies, whether that's a Morph-O-Ray to turn them into Chickens, or the <a href=\"/ryno/3055-494/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-494\">R.Y.N.O</a> to obliterate all in sight.</p><h2>Storyline</h2><p>On a distant planet, a small robot manages to escape a production plant, only to be shot down while trying to get away in a small shuttle. Meanwhile, on the planet of <a href=\"/planet-veldin/3035-468/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-468\">Veldin</a>, <a href=\"/ratchet/3005-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-120\">Ratchet</a> is working on fixing his own ship at his garage. Suddenly, he spots something falling from the sky, landing not far from where he was working. He finds the small robot and brings it back with him, naming it ' <a href=\"/clank/3005-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-323\">Clank</a>'.</p><p>When Clank has recovered, he shows Ratchet a message from an Infobot. It features <a href=\"/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3237\">Chairman Drek</a>, explaining how his home planet of Blarg has become so over-polluted that it is becoming impossible to live there anymore. To solve this problem, Drek reveals his plans - taking large parts from various planets, from across the <a href=\"/solana-galaxy/3035-466/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-466\">Solana Galaxy</a>, then combining them into one new area for the Blarg to live. Clank suggest they try to find <a href=\"/captain-qwark/3005-758/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-758\">Captain Qwark</a>, the galaxy's most famous hero, to warn him of Drek's plans. Realizing his own planet is under threat, Ratchet agrees.</p><p>During their flight, Ratchet's faulty ship causes trouble again, and they end up crash landing at Novalis. While there, they receive a new ship from a native, and an infobot, containing an ad for Al's Roboshack, featuring Captain Qwark. They then fly on to Metropolis, to meet <a href=\"/big-al/3005-2937/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2937\">Big Al</a>. Although he doesnt know where Qwark is, and hadn't seen him since they filmed the advert, he does upgrade Clank, installing a Heli-Pak.</p><p>Eventually, they do find Qwark, and meet up with him at his challenge course at Umbris. After they complete the course, Qwark traps them, surrounding the pair with lava. Here, he reveals his involvement with Chairman Drek, hoping it will lead to a job oppurtunity on the newly formed planet. He then leaves them to fight a Snagglebeast, expecting they would both be defeated.</p><p>After they escape, Ratchet becomes angry towards Clank, and even more so towards Qwark, vowing to get revenge on the hero. After travelling to many planets, they manage to track down Qwark, defeating him in a space battle. After this, Ratchet sees Drek destroying a nearby planet and realises how un-caring he had become. He then vows to co-operate with Clank to try defeat Drek.</p><p>They gain more information about Drek's plans to use the Deplanetizer, and discover that Ratchet's home planet of Veldin is next in line for destruction. They rush back to the planet, and confront Drek. He proceeds to tell them how it was his plan all along to pollute his home planet, knowing he could make money selling land on the new one. A large battle between him and the duo ensues in which Drek is eventually defeated. Clank notices that the Deplanetizer's position has moved and is now pointing at Blarg, Drek's home planet. Before they can do anything, the machine activates and destroys Blarg.</p><p>After this, the two become overnight celebrities, featured in media across the galaxy.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Over the top weapons became a staple of the series, after the first game introduced some wild and innovative methods of destroying enemies. Unlike later games, Ratchet &amp; Clank didn't feature the ability for weapons to gain experience and upgrade themselves. Instead Gold Bolts could be 'attached' to the player's arsenal to augment the power.</p><p>The weapons available in the game include:</p><ul><li><b>Bomb Glove (Free) Ammo: 40 Bombs</b></li></ul><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1070583\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73977695167286\" data-width=\"538\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 538px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1070583\"><img alt=\"The Bomb Glove\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg 538w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Bomb Glove</figcaption></figure><p>The Gadgetron Bomb Glove is a staple weapon of the Ratchet and Clank games, with most other titles in the series featuring this weapon or one that is very similar.

The glove fires eggs which each carry four Agents.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1092135-mine_glove.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1092135\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75086505190311\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1092135-mine_glove.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1092135\"><img alt=\"The Mine Glove\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1092135-mine_glove.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1092135-mine_glove.png 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Mine Glove\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1092135-mine_glove.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1717/1092135-mine_glove.png 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Mine Glove</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Mine Glove (7,500 bolts) Ammo: 50 Mines</b></li></ul><p>A glove that threw hovering mines that would stay stationary until it detected an enemy.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Jak II, sometimes subtitled Renegade, is the second game in Naughty Dog's Jak series and a significant departure from the original game <a href=\"/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy/3030-14623/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14623\">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</a>. Rather than being a mostly on-foot collectible-focused platformer, Jak II features a lot more vehicle sections and an open city to explore, not unlike <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a>. The tone of the game shifted also, moving to a darker, grittier story and environment with more sci-fi aspects, rather than the cartoony and picturesque islands of the original.</p><p>Jak II was released in late 2003 for the PlayStation 2. It was eventually re-released in the <a href=\"/jak-and-daxter-collection/3030-36890/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36890\">Jak and Daxter Collection</a> which was compatible with the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita. <a href=\"/daxter/3030-14604/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14604\">Daxter</a>, a separate PSP game released three years later in 2006, is a prequel that leads directly up to the events of Jak II.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Jak II differs greatly to Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy as well. Although the core platforming elements remain, it features a GTA-style world which Jak can roam around in freely, \"HiJak\" various hovercars, and obtain weapons through the course of the story. Overall, both the gameplay and story have a much darker feel than the first game and this is exemplified by the Dark Jak transformation. Dark eco is collected, and when enough is procured, the option to become this alter ego temporarily is made available. When transformed, Jak takes on a more animalistic look and has far stronger melee attacks, however he cannot use his projectile weapons. Dark Jak's abilities can be extended if Metal Head Skull Gems are collected and traded. The game is renowned for its wide variety of gameplay, venturing into the genres of action, platforming, racing, on-rails shooting, rhythm action, skating (on a Hoverboard), Mech fighting and nigh on innumerable others.</p><h3>Shooting</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414419-jak2_11_resize.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-414419\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414419-jak2_11_resize.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-414419\"><img alt=\"Jak holding the Scatter gun\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/414419-jak2_11_resize.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414419-jak2_11_resize.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/414419-jak2_11_resize.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jak holding the Scatter gun</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting in the game is handled by an auto-targeting system. Jak shoots what he's facing with a tap of the R1 button, but the player can see what he's aiming at and adjust his position accordingly thanks to a laser sight mounted onto what is technically the game's only weapon, the <a href=\"/morph-gun/3055-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1466\">Morph Gun</a>.</p><p>The Morph Gun is awarded to Jak by <a href=\"/krew/3005-7372/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7372\">Krew</a> part-way through the story and has four different transformations: the shotgun-like Scatter Gun, the Power Blaster, the machine-gun esque Vulcan and the ironically titled Peacemaker that Jak receives near the end of the game.</p><h3>Free Roaming and Driving</h3><p>Haven City is a free roaming environment, and as a result, Jak can hijack the different types of hovercars and hoverbikes that crowd Haven City's streets. Although there were limited hoverbike sections featured in The Precursor Legacy, the basic handling is the same. One major difference is that Jak can hover at two levels; either close to the ground or several meters in the air, which helps him navigate the the city much faster. There are also hoverbike races which Jak can compete in at the Stadium, and though they must remain just above ground, the handling is tighter and acceleration and top speed are vastly superior. Without the use of vehicles, it would be difficult to traverse the city in anything approaching a reasonable time, so acquiring them becomes second nature and a core element of gameplay and simply getting around.</p><p>Just as in <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\">Grand Theft Auto III</a>, if Jak draws the attention of the police, the Krimson Guard, the city goes on alert. By bumping into a guard or in story driven moments, Jak can begin an alert that begins with individual guards trying to shoot him down and escalates into Guard hovercraft using their powerful lasers to finish the job. The player can escape alert by getting out of the red alert circle on the minimap and staying hidden until the guards relent.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-213447\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-213447\"><img alt=\"Jak and Daxter\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3447/213447-0000000.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Jak and Daxter</figcaption></figure><p>Jak II is the sequel to Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy and picks up the story a few hours after the first game finished. The mysterious vehicle found at the end of the first game is brought to the home of Samos the sage along with the Precursor ring that was also found. Jak manages to activate the vehicle which violently transports Jak, Daxter, <a href=\"/samos/3005-2253/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2253\">Samos</a> and <a href=\"/keira/3005-3416/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3416\">Keira</a> into a strange world. Upon awakening, Jak is immediately arrested by the Krimson Guard under the rule of <a href=\"/baron-praxis/3005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3190\">Baron Praxis</a>. Jak is subjected to torturous experimentation until two years later Daxter finds him in jail and frees him.</p><p>Jak joins a small resistance group in the slums who want to overthrow the tyrannical rule of Baron Praxis. The members include <a href=\"/torn/3005-3995/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3995\">Torn</a>, the hardened leader, an old man known as <a href=\"/kor/3005-7373/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7373\">Kor</a>, a young unnamed boy, and <a href=\"/ashelin/3005-4426/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4426\">Ashelin</a>, who is the Baron's daughter.</p><p>Wanting revenge, Jak starts to work for a variety of characters with the sole aim of getting him closer to meeting his foe. By working his way up the ranks of the resistance, Jak comes into contact with the leader of the group known as 'The Shadow', who turns out to be a younger Samos the sage. It is discovered that the Baron is dealing Eco to an evil race of creatures known as the metal heads to keep them from invading and destroying the city. The resistance are harboring a small child referred to only as 'The Boy' or 'The Kid' who has the ability to open the tomb of the ancient leader, Mar, which contains a Precursor stone which can be used for great power.</p><p>Jak enters the tomb instead of the boy and upon finding the stone comes into contact with Baron Praxis who overpowers Jak and takes the stone for himself. It is then revealed by Samos that Praxis intends on breaking the stone to find its power which, unbeknownst to him, would cause incredible destruction.</p><p>Jak manages to win the class one race against Praxis' right hand man, <a href=\"/erol/3005-7375/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7375\">Erol</a>, and gains the prize of the opportunity to meet the Baron himself. Instead of Praxis, Jak finds Ashelin who refuses to believe allegations against her father but is forced to believe what she hears after finding out what the breaking of the Precursor stone would do. She tells Jak that the crime lord Krew, who Jak had been working for, has built a bomb powerful enough to destroy the metal head nest and the Precursor stone in one. Jak finds Krew and confronts him, a battle that leaves Krew near death. Krew sets off the bomb in an attempt to kill Jak, but Ashelin provides an escape for Jak just in time, leaving Krew to perish.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198545\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 500px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198545\"><img alt=\"Jak's Ground Pound\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jak's Ground Pound\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5779/198545-jak2_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jak's Ground Pound</figcaption></figure><p>Jak then confronts the Baron at a construction site but is interrupted by Kor, who demands that Praxis hands the Precursor stone to him. It is here that Kor's true identity as the metal head leader is unveiled and he kills Baron Praxis before heading to the metal head nest. Before dying, Praxis tells Jak that Jak has the power to destroy Kor and that the precursor stone is on a second bomb. Daxter disarms the bomb and obtains the stone. Using Mar's cannon, Jak and Daxter enter the nest for a final confrontation with Kor who has both the boy and the rift ring from the beginning of the game. Kor reveals to Jak that the boy is in fact him as he was born in the future and sent back in time to live the events of the first game in order to be ready to face Kor on this day, he also tells Jak that his attempt is futile now as the Dark Eco inside him prevents him from using the Precursor stone to unleash its power. After a grueling battle Jak proves Kor wrong and beats him. In a last attempt at saving himself, Kor tries to destroy the rift by ramming into it, but ends up dying upon impact. Young Jak touches the Precursor stone and becomes imbued with Light Eco, which explains why Jak was not destroyed by the Dark Eco. Young Samos is ordered to go back in time to watch over Jak and the two quickly manage to get through the gate before it collapses. The game ends with celebrations at Daxter's recently obtained bar.</p><h2>Setting and Locations</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-414423\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-414423\"><img alt=\"Daxter and Pecker in Onin's tent\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Daxter and Pecker in Onin's tent\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/414423-jak2pic5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Daxter and Pecker in Onin's tent</figcaption></figure><p>The game's setting is the sprawling metropolitan urban area Haven City, the large, angular, metallic structures of which stand in stark contrast to the original's bright, colorful, rural locales. Haven is a technologically advanced, though dystopian, vision of the same land's future (as Jak discovers around two thirds into the story).</p><p>The authoritarian Krimson Guard, under the command of Baron Praxis and his corrupt, deceitful right hand man Erol, run the various zones of the main city, which include a shanty town, a mystical marketplace, a stadium (used for races), a slum, a central area where the Baron's palace resides and a waterfront boulevard surrounded by businesses. There are also many districts outside the city boundaries that are used for missions, such as a pumping station, ruins of Sandover Village and the beautifully realized and atmospheric Haven Forest.</p><h2>Criticism</h2><p>Jak II is widely known for featuring a darker and much more pessimistic tone, emphasizing the newer \"edgy\" attitude of the series. Such changes like equipping Jak with firearms, along with the use of mild profanity (such as Daxter's infamous use of the word \"damn\") made the game appear somewhat darker than the previous. As a result of the light profanity and violence, Jak II was the first Jak title to achieve an T rating from the ESRB.</p><p>Despite the attempt to make the game more approachable to a larger crowd, Jak II was generally panned for the same reasons that the game had chosen to emphasize to make the game more mature. The gunplay was widely criticized due to awkward control and camera. Daxter's language and use of vehicles were generally considered unnecessary.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><b>#</b></th><th><b>Song Title</b></th><th><b>Artist</b></th><th><b>Time</b></th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Title</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>0:38</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Escaping The Fortress</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>3:47</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Guard Trouble 1</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:17</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Guard Trouble 2</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:35</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Haven City Walking</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>4:28</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Haven City Hover Vehicle</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>4:19</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Haven City Guard Pursuit</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:23</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Dead Town</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>3:43</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Under Attack In Dead Town</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:41</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Armed In Dead Town</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:56</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>The Pumping Station</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>3:03</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Under Attack At Pumping Station</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:24</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Armed at the Pumping Station</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:25</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Fortress Tank Trouble</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:12</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Armed in the Fortress</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:30</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>The Strip Mine</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:31</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Under Attack at the Strip Mine</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:41</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Armed at the Strip Mine</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:29</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Mountain Temple</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:44</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Under Attack at Mountain Temple</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:11</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Armed at the Mountain Temple</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:25</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>First Baron Praxis Battle</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>0:57</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Praxis Palace</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:43</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Armed in Praxis Palace</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:35</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Jet-Board in Haven City</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>4:21</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Haven Forest</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>3:42</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Jet-Board in Haven Forest</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>3:35</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Dragons of Haven Forest</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:40</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Armed in Haven Forest</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>3:35</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Onin Game</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:55</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Baron Battle at Mar's Tomb</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:58</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Race with Erol</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>1:45</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Battle with Krew</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:14</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Final Battle with Metal Kor</td><td>Mark Mothersbaugh, Josh Mancell, and Larry Hopkins</td><td>2:24</td></tr></tbody></table>",

The Forbidden Land that these colossi inhabit is both expansive and serene, with no other enemies in between the sixteen boss battles. Wander begins the game with a sword and bow and arrows, the only weapons provided to defeat all of the colossi.</p><p>Many <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss fights</a> combine elements of platforming and puzzle-solving, as different strategies will need to be executed in order to climb the larger colossi and reach their weak points. Some battles involve using the surrounding environment in very specific ways.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>The player only has two weapons throughout the course of the game: a sword and a bow.</p><ul><li>By holding the sword up to the sunlight, the direction to the next colossi will be revealed. The reflected sunlight also reveals the location of their weak points.</li><li>The bow is much less a weapon as it is a tool. Players will find that arrows are largely ineffective against the colossi, but will attract their attention. Wander carries unlimited arrows.</li><li>Although players will not find any new weapons in their journey, it is possible for them to collect new items and upgrades by defeating the game's massive bosses again in a Time Attack mode. These new items range from a cloak that functions as a parachute to a whistling arrow capable of attracting the attention of the colossi to a the Queen's Sword from Ico.</li></ul><h3>Agro</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317080\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317080\"><img alt=\"Agro, Wander's loyal steed\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/317080-agro.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Agro, Wander's loyal steed</figcaption></figure><p>Wander is joined by Agro, his horse and sole companion on this adventure. Many colossi require Agro's assistance to take down, whether it be to mount the colossus, or simply keep a step ahead. When riding Agro, players are able to use the bow and aim independently of the horse's direction, even firing arrows directly behind Wander. Players can also perform certain tricks and stunts, such as standing on top of the horse, hanging down to the side, or even jumping off at full speed - propelling the player to places otherwise out of reach.</p><p>One aspect that makes Agro unique is how alive he seems to the player. He will only go at the pace Wander makes him, he gets spooked by colossi and loud noises, and he often navigates away from ledges on his own.</p><h3>Tracking</h3><p>Before players fight the colossi, they will first need to track them down. This is made simple by Wander's magical sword. When standing in sunlight, pressing and holding the circle button will result in him raising his sword towards the sky. A beam of light emanating from the tip will then point directly to the colossi the player is hunting. It is then up to the player to navigate their way through the landscape towards their destination.</p><h3>The Colossi</h3><p>Once successfully finding these colossi, the next goal - take them down. As fearsome as these look, they do have weak points - which can be easily found by raising the sword. However, the challenge lies in actually reaching these areas. There are sixteen battles in total, all epic in scale, but each of the colossi has a unique weakness which will need to be exploited in order to reach and attack its weak point. The player must figure out how to get on the colossus, and often must get its attention by whistling or shooting at it with the bow. Eventually, players will be able to climb atop each beast, clinging to their fur as they try to throw Wander off, and once reaching each weak point, Wander will prepare his sword and gain strength by pressing or holding the square button. Upon a second a button press, the sword will be plunged into the colossi for massive damage, resulting in a fountain of black blood. By attacking the weak points, the colossus will eventually fall. Each battle could be considered a puzzle, and players will need to use their wits, the surrounding environment, and in some cases - their horse, in order to achieve victory.</p><h3>Grip System</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/921059-30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921059\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/921059-30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921059\"><img alt=\"The game's HUD\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/921059-30.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The game's HUD\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/921059-30.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/921059-30.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's HUD</figcaption></figure><p>By holding the R1 button, Wander will grab onto what ever he can - ledges, fur of the colossi, even fish and birds -- and be able to move around whilst doing so in most cases. However, he won't be able to hold on indefinitely. As Wander climbs about, or struggles to hold on to a thrashing Colossi, he will steadily lose his grip. This is represented as a pink circle in the bottom right-corner of</p><p>the screen, and as grip deteriorates and the circle will slowly drain. When entirely depleted, Wander will then let go and fall. Thankfully, grip naturally regenerates when the player is not holding on to anything, and so players will need to pick choice moments during fights in which to regain their grip before continuing. A similar \"grip\" system is used while swimming. The grip meter slowly increases in size over the game, growing after defeating each Colossus.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>Like so many other games, a gauge representing health is displayed as a red bar at the bottom of the screen, which depletes as Wander takes damage. Falling or being stepped on will harm Wander. Wander will slowly regain health as time passes, but he can also crouch or pat Agro which will speed up the regeneration. By gathering fruit, the player can increase Wander's health.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204715\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204715\"><img alt=\"Wander arrives at the Shrine with Mono\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wander arrives at the Shrine with Mono\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3068/204715-mono.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wander arrives at the Shrine with Mono</figcaption></figure><p>As the story begins, we see <a href=\"/wander/3005-678/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-678\">Wander</a> riding his faithful horse, <a href=\"/agro/3005-1126/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1126\">Agro</a>, and carrying a body wrapped in a cloak into the Forbidden Land. As he approaches the huge <a href=\"/shrine-of-worship/3035-471/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-471\">Shrine of Worship</a> at the center of the land, he lays the body upon the altar.

Soon after, an ethereal voice is heard, that of <a href=\"/dormin/3005-1740/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1740\">Dormin</a>, a bodiless entity who is surprised to see Wander carrying the sword. Wander begs Dormin to grant Mono her soul back, but Dormin says he will need something from Wander in return. Dormin explains that Mono's soul can only return to her body if Wander traverses the land that he has entered and seeks out sixteen colossi that lie hidden throughout the land, and slay them, an act which can only be achieved by using the ancient sword.</p><p>He quickly agrees, but Dormin warns him that he will pay a great penalty in return for Mono's soul, but this does not hinder Wander, who immediately sets out to follow his sword and find the sixteen colossi.</p><p>Following the death of each Colossus, Wander appears more distorted and depleted. He grows paler, his hair darker, and small horns grow from his head. On the contrary, Mono's body appears stronger with each Colossus killed, and her voice is heard briefly throughout the game.</p><p>After the death of the <a href=\"/the-twelfth-colossus/3005-1166/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1166\">Twelfth Colossus</a>, a <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene</a> shows a shaman, <a href=\"/emon/3005-12322/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12322\">Lord Emon</a>, who leads a group of warriors into the Forbidden Land.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509099\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509099\"><img alt=\"The Third Colossus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 1500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Third Colossus\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 1500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4462/1509099-1158375808314.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Third Colossus</figcaption></figure><p>As Wander proceeds, he is hurried by Dormin to conquer the final <a href=\"/the-sixteenth-colossus/3005-1170/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1170\">sixteenth beast</a>. On his way to the final Colossus, Wander travels by horseback over a long stone bridge that immediately begins to collapse. Agro, sensing the danger, reaches the end and suddenly bucks Wander off, who lands safely, whilst Agro collapses along with the bridge.</p><p>As Wander defeats the last of the Colossus, Lord Emon and his gang of warriors appear in the Shrine of Worship as the last of the idols representing the Colossi crumbles to the ground. Soon after, Wander appears in the temple, with his eyes and skin entirely pale and his head showing two protruding horns. As Wander struggles to reach to Mono, Lord Emon declares Wander to be '<a href=\"/possession/3015-819/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-819\">possessed</a>' and a warrior shoots him in his leg with a crossbow. Another warrior stabs him with his sword through the chest. As Wander crumples to the ground, his blood sprays black and he falls in a very similar fashion to the sixteen Colossi he had just slain.</p><p>Dormin then possesses Wander's body, transforming into a shadowy giant. He explains that his own soul was cast from his body to limit his power. As Emon's men flee, Emon casts the sword into a pool of water in the back of the shrine. A blinding light is emitted, which consumes both Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men run across the bridge at the entrance of the Shrine of Worship as it begins to collapse. As Emon and his men safely escape, Emon ponders Wander's fate, hoping that one day he will be able to atone for his actions.</p><p>Back in the shrine, Mono awakens from her sleep and rises from the altar. As Agro wanders into the temple with an injured hind leg, Mono follows him to the back of the Shrine towards the pool of water where Emon drew Dormin and Wander. There they find an infant with two horns on his head. Agro continues to lead them to the top of the shrine, where a secret garden lies, overlooking the forbidden lands as the game ends.</p><h2>The Sixteen Colossi</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-387341\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-387341\"><img alt=\"Concept art of the First Colossus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 1600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Concept art of the First Colossus\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 1600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2130/387341-shadow1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Concept art of the First Colossus</figcaption></figure><p>No official names have ever been assigned to the game's sixteen Colossi, but fans have given unofficial monikers to each of them for the sake of reference.

Shadow of the Colossus was chosen to appear in the film because of the falling colossi's resemblance to the falling of the Twin Towers in New York - a key concept in the movie.</li><li>Shadow of the Colossus was called \"Nico\" while in development. This is a combination of \"Ni\", the Japanese word for \"two\" and \"Ico\", a previous game from this developer. This lead to fan speculation that it would indeed be a direct sequel to the cult-hit, <a href=\"/ico/3030-9638/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9638\">Ico.</a> The game was originally devolved as a <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-op</a> game where up to 4 players would work together on taking down a Colossus.

It features a new single-player campaign which concludes the story of the security officer at the center of both <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20232\" href=\"/marathon/3030-20232/\">Marathon</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1921\" href=\"/marathon-2-durandal/3030-1921/\">Marathon 2: Durandal</a>, three exceedingly challenging \"Vidmaster\" maps, and also 23 netmaps to bolster's Marathon's multiplayer mode. Perhaps most prominently, the game shipped with Forge, a Marathon map editor, and Anvil, a utility for editing weapons, enemies, textures, sounds, and the like. Marathon Infinity was so named because of these tools, as they were intended to extend the life of the game indefinitely by giving fans access to essentially the same tools Bungie used to make their maps. The importance of Forge and Anvil in this release can be seen in the game's manual, which devotes over half of its length to explaining the proper use of these utilities.</p><p>Unlike the previous game, Marathon Infinity was never officially ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\">PC</a>, and like the original game it is only legally playable on modern systems due to the 1999 release of the Marathon 2 source code, which led to the development of the cross-platform <a href=\"http://source.bungie.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aleph One</a> project, and the official freeware release of the Trilogy in 2005, which allows all three games in the series to be freely downloaded. More recently, as part of Bungie's 20th Anniversary celebration in 2011, the source code to Marathon Infinity was officially made public.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The story of Marathon Infinity represents a fairly dramatic structural departure from the more traditional narratives of its forebears. As <a data-ref-id=\"3040-14715\" href=\"/greg-kirkpatrick/3040-14715/\">Greg Kirkpatrick</a>, the principal writer on all three Marathon games, explains it, Infinity's story was intended to be an \"experiment\" in discovering \"how much people could digest from a complex, hard to follow story.\" The nature of many of the game's events as well as their meaning in the context of the story are not explicitly made clear to the player, who is expected to instead piece them together based on terminal messages and prior knowledge of the series, and as a result the specifics of what is taking place during the game's scenario, entitled \"Blood Tides of Lh'owon\", was and continues to be a source of some debate among the Marathon fan community. One of the few undisputed facts is that the player character's primary motivation is to stop an eldritch being named the W'rkncacnter, which was released from its imprisonment in Lh'owon's sun at the end of Marathon 2. This beast of chaos, if left unchecked, would spell the death of the known universe.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174781-marathon_infinity_ending.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174781\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174781-marathon_infinity_ending.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174781\"><img alt=\"Infinity's storyline waxes far more metaphysical than its predecessors.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174781-marathon_infinity_ending.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174781-marathon_infinity_ending.png 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2174781-marathon_infinity_ending.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></a><figcaption>Infinity's storyline waxes far more metaphysical than its predecessors.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the more widely held interpretations of Infinity's storyline is that the security officer is being transported by ancient Jjaro technology into alternate timelines (other interpretations postulate that it is the W'rkncacnter's influence that is transporting him, or that he is merely dreaming), wherein he must find a means to prevent the W'rkncacnter from being unleashed. Of the more confusing aspects from an interpretive standpoint is that it is never specifically stated that the player is traveling through time, space, or the mind, and furthermore within these timelines no one appears to be aware of the fact that the player character is experiencing this phenomenon. These excursions are set for the most part contemporaneous to the second game's storyline as the player (presumably) tries to correct the course of events which led to the Pfhor's launching of the trih xeem device, which precipitated the release of the W'rkncacnter. In some scenarios, the security officer will experience wildly different realities in which he fights alongside <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3380\" href=\"/tycho/3005-3380/\">Tycho</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1134\" href=\"/pfhor/3015-1134/\">Pfhor</a>, while in others he aids <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3402\" href=\"/durandal/3005-3402/\">Durandal</a> and his men as he did in the previous game.</p><p>Intermittently the player is transported to surreal transitional levels which seem to signal the end of one timeline and the beginning of another, and in addition it is possible for the player to prematurely access versions of the game's final level before they have the means to truly complete it, driving home that the purpose of these jumps is to create a favorable outcome which allows him to subdue the W'rkncacnter. Eventually, the player will find their way to the final level, an ancient Jjaro station which presents the key to containing the W'rkncacnter. The security officer is seemingly successful in his efforts, however the game's epilogue leaves the full impact of the game's proceedings open to interpretation.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p><i>See also: <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1921\" href=\"/marathon-2-durandal/3030-1921/\">Marathon 2</a></i></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174783\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174783\"><img alt=\"Extremely tough grey Pfhor materialize later in the game.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Extremely tough grey Pfhor materialize later in the game.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118253/2174783-pfhor_super_fighter.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Extremely tough grey Pfhor materialize later in the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay is mostly unchanged between Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity. Most levels require the player to traverse a large expanse in order to complete a certian objective or objectives, after which point the player can be teleported to the next stage by way of a computer terminal within the environment. As a consequence of the player's frequent shifting between realities, many maps will feature the Pfhor as allies and Durandal's human forces as enemies, and exactly what constitutes friend or foe changes a number of times over the course of the game. The campaign also features a number of story-relevant secret levels as well as two additional \"coop carnage break\" levels intended for those playing through the game cooperatively. The aforementioned secret levels can be accessed from one of three near-identical \"Electric Sheep\" levels interspersed throughout the campaign, and from here players can also skip or replay large swaths of the game if they so choose, reinforcing the notion that the game's story does not unfold in a strictly chronological fashion. Also of note is the fact that Infinity features the return of vacuum levels in which the player's oxygen supply is slowly diminishing, which was a mechanic entirely absent in the second game.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>All of Marathon 2's weapons return in Infinity, accompanied by a single new addition: the KKV-7 10mm SMG Flechette. As before, the protagonist's ability to use individual weapons is limited not only by their access to them but also the player's current circumstances. Almost all weapons are completely useless while submerged, for instance, and certain armaments, such as the Assault Rifle and the SPNKR-XP, are simply not suitable for use in depressurized atmospheres.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width\"><thead><tr><th>Appearance</th><th>Pickup Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174785-smg_flechette.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174785\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4117647058824\" data-width=\"85\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 85px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174785-smg_flechette.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174785\"><img alt=\"KKV-7 10mm SMG Flechette\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px\" data-width=\"85\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174785-smg_flechette.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174785-smg_flechette.png 85w\"><noscript><img alt=\"KKV-7 10mm SMG Flechette\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174785-smg_flechette.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174785-smg_flechette.png 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 85px) 100vw, 85px\" data-width=\"85\"></noscript></a><figcaption>KKV-7 10mm SMG Flechette</figcaption></figure></td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174784-smg_flechette_icon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174784\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56043956043956\" data-width=\"91\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 91px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174784-smg_flechette_icon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174784\"><img alt=\"SMG Flechette Pickup\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 91px) 100vw, 91px\" data-width=\"91\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174784-smg_flechette_icon.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174784-smg_flechette_icon.png 91w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SMG Flechette Pickup\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174784-smg_flechette_icon.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174784-smg_flechette_icon.png 91w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 91px) 100vw, 91px\" data-width=\"91\"></noscript></a><figcaption>SMG Flechette Pickup</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>KKV-7 10mm SMG Flechette</h3>As Marthon Infinity's only new weapon, the KKV-7 is an extremely versatile armament that can be used in almost any situation. It is the only firearm in the game which can be discharged underwater without causing harm to the player, and it can furthermore be used safely in a vacuum. Due to its longer and more pointed gun barrel, it is also much more accurate than the standard Assault Rifle. Like most ballistic weapons in Marathon, though, it is not very effective against armored targets, and it suffers somewhat from a fairly small magazine and a general paucity of ammo in most levels.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Enemies</h3><p>The player will encounter primarily the same enemies in Infinity that were on display in Marathon 2. Due to the nature of the single-player game, many enemies will show up as allied units during specific missions, and furthermore unit types that were previously only allies, such as Bobs and S'pht'Kr, may appear to be hostile depending on the scenario. Introduced in Marathon Infinity are several grey \"super\" versions of standard Marathon enemies, which are far tougher, deadlier, and faster than their normal counterparts, although these mostly factor into the game's penultimate level, \"You Think You're Big Time? You're Gonna Die Big Time!\" In terms of entirely new enemy types, the only unit fitting of the description is a new vacuum-suited human opponent called the \"Vacuum Bob.\"</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width\"><thead><tr><th>Appearance</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174786-vacuum_bob.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174786\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.8909090909091\" data-width=\"55\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 55px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:289.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174786-vacuum_bob.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174786\"><img alt=\"Vacuum Bob\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" data-width=\"55\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174786-vacuum_bob.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174786-vacuum_bob.png 55w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Vacuum Bob\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174786-vacuum_bob.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2174786-vacuum_bob.png 55w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\" data-width=\"55\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Vacuum Bob</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Vacuum Bob</h3>Introduced about midway through the game, Vacuum Bobs are so named due the vacuum-sealed armor suits that they wear. They are significantly more hardy than the average Bob, and are also outfitted standard with Zeus-Class Fusion Pistols, making them more dangerous opponents. Vacuum Bobs come in either blue or green varieties, with the latter of them being the tougher of the two. Much like Hunters, they will undergo a \"violent\" death if killed with certain weaponry, such as the Fusion Pistol. When this happens, the Bob in question will explode rather than simply crumpling to the floor, causing splash damage to any nearby targets.</td></tr></tbody></table>",

A reboot of the <a href=\"/prince-of-persia/3030-2561/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2561\">original</a> Prince of Persia <a href=\"/prince-of-persia/3025-431/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-431\">franchise</a>, development of the game included collaboration with the original series' creator, <a href=\"/jordan-mechner/3040-2643/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2643\">Jordan Mechner</a>, who is credited in the game as writer and game designer.</p><p>Sands of Time places players in control of a character known only as <a href=\"/the-prince/3005-2623/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2623\">the Prince</a>, son of King Sharaman of Persia. While on a journey to a neighboring kingdom, the Prince unknowingly releases the cursed <a href=\"/sands-of-time/3055-259/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-259\">Sands of Time</a>. The rest of the game pits the player against sands demons - former humans transformed by the Sands - and an even deadlier environment.</p><p>The premise is used to divide the game into two segments: combat and platforming. Most of the player's time is spent utilizing the Prince's vast array of acrobatic techniques to navigate the palace. These platforming segments are broken up by combat against the palace's transformed denizens. In combat, the Prince's acrobatic strengths are augmented by his formidable swordsmanship. Both segments often require the aid of the <a href=\"/dagger-of-time/3055-155/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-155\">Dagger of Time</a>, a magical relic that can manipulate time itself and undo mistakes made by the player.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Platforming is the central gameplay element to Sands of Time. To navigate the palace, the Prince must utilize every skill in his acrobatic arsenal: from simple running and jumping to running along walls, dodging hazards, and swinging from poles. The environment can be as dangerous as any sand demon; the palace is littered with spikes, saws, and blades.</p><p>Accompanying the levels are light puzzle elements, forcing the Prince to pull switches, manipulate mirrors, and search for hidden pathways.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-766728\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-766728\"><img alt=\"Engaging the enemy with acrobatics\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/766728-sot_133.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Engaging the enemy with acrobatics</figcaption></figure><p>Breaking up the platforming and puzzle elements are faster-paced combat segments. Again, the Prince must use his acrobatic abilities to best his opponents by leaping, rolling, and outmaneuvering his assailants. Defeating the sand demons requires the use of both sword and dagger. The sword is used to force enemies to the ground, which if left unattended will rise to fight again. Only by using the magical Dagger of Time can the Prince strike a finishing blow that will banish the sand demon and absorb the cursed sands.</p><p>During both platforming and combat, the player will often make mistakes and require assistance. Help comes in the form of the Dagger of Time's magical abilities, beginning with the ability to rewind time and undo mistakes (and unfortunate deaths). Through the course of the game, new dagger techniques are unlocked: the ability to slow time and freeze enemies. Needless to say, the dagger is often critical to the success of the player.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-756962\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-756962\"><img alt=\"Father and son prepare to attack.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Father and son prepare to attack.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/756962-pop_7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Father and son prepare to attack.</figcaption></figure><p>The story opens with King <a href=\"/sharaman/3005-8597/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8597\">Sharaman</a> of Persia secretly waiting with an army outside an Indian city. The traitorous <a href=\"/vizier/3005-3579/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3579\">Vizier</a>, advisor to the Indian Maharaja, makes a deal with the enemy forces: the Vizier will kill the night watchmen and raise the gates, and in return the King will give the Vizier his choice among the looted treasures.</p><p>During the ensuing raid, the Prince seeks to earn honor and glory in the eyes of his father, but has little taste for the violence of combat. He leaves his father's forces and searches for a way into the Maharaja's treasure vault. Once there, he claims for himself a mysterious dagger which he believes will earn him the prestige he seeks.</p><p>The city conquered, the Vizier is allowed to choose any item from the treasure vault except, decrees the king, the dagger claimed by his son and a giant hourglass which the king decides will be a gift to a neighboring kingdom. The Vizier is furious; these were precisely the items he desired.</p><p>The king and his forces depart from the looted city, making their way to the Kingdom of Azad, whose sultan is a friend and ally. King Sharaman presents the sultan with the Hourglass of Time, which the Vizier explains contains wonders no living mortal has seen. He entreats the Prince to open the hourglass with the companion Dagger of Time, but when the Prince does so, the Vizier begins chanting magical incantations which spread the sands in a violent whirlwind. The sands begin consuming the palace's inhabitants, turning them into vile sand demons. The Vizier demands the Prince give him the dagger, but the Prince flees.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-757036\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-757036\"><img alt=\"\"Why does it glow?\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2891/757036-pop_35.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Why does it glow?\"</figcaption></figure><p>Not long after, the Prince witnesses the hourglass carried away by a flock of birds, flying the artifact to the Tower of Dawn.

On his journey he teams up with the spirited <a href=\"/farah/3005-1141/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1141\">Princess Farah</a>, daughter of the conquered Maharaja. Together they navigate the palace's labyrinthine corridors and deadly traps.</p><p>The Prince's feelings toward the princess fluctuate between attraction and suspicion. He appreciates her company and begins to care for her but also suspects she desires only to claim the dagger much like the Vizier. Their time together culminates in a night of passion, but when the Prince awakens he finds Farah and the Dagger of Time missing.</p><p>He pursues and finds her overwhelmed by a horde of sands demons. He attempts to rescue her but is too late. She falls to her death. Disgusted with his selfish pride and the destruction it has caused to everything he cares about, the Prince climbs the Tower of Dawn and plunges the Dagger of Time into the magical hourglass. Doing so magically retrieves the cursed sands but also begins to rewind time. Time rewinds faster and faster until the Prince finds himself back in the war camp on the night of the raid!</p><p>Determined to stop the raid of the Maharaja's kingdom, the Prince infiltrates the city and locates the Princess Farah's bedchamber. Unfortunately, she too is a victim of the hourglass's magic and does not remember the Prince or their adventures together.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Talos Principle takes place across a series of environments which resemble the buildings of ancient civilisations but peppered with modern technological elements such as PCs and QR codes. Within these spaces the player takes control of a robot, instructed by a god-like figure to complete the puzzles available to them. Common gameplay elements include \"Jammers\", devices which can be used to disable enemies or open doorways, and \"Connectors\", devices which can be used to create rudimentary circuits. Using these and other tools, players must collect the \"Sigils\" hidden in each stage. When all of a certain class of Sigil are collected, the player must connect them together in a <a href=\"/tetris/3030-1896/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1896\">Tetris</a>-like grid puzzle to unlock new areas or items. Throughout levels, players can also find messages left across the walls by what seem to be older participants in the puzzles. They can also periodically access a computer system which contains cryptic texts, messages from the developers of a computer program, and a simple AI. The AI often challenges the philosophical beliefs of the player, using rationalist and Socratic lines of thought.</p><p>DLC content, titled Road to Gehenna, was released 23 July, 2015.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Bionic Commando Rearmed is an update to the <a href=\"/bionic-commando/3030-7860/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7860\"> original 8-bit classic</a> originally released on the NES in 1988. The game is a \"2.5-D\" side scrolling shooter and retains all of the shooting and swinging of the original. The game features a new soundtrack with remixes of the original music, as well as the anime-inspired \"Go! Go! Bionic\" theme song. The CD is available on iTunes, <a href=\"https://www.sumthingdigital.com/AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=3664\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sumthing Digital</a> and the Bionic Commando website. The game features two player co-op, and new bionic arm abilities. Rearmed sticks to the original's story of <a href=\"/nathan-rad-spencer/3005-124/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-124\"> Nathan \"Rad\" Spencer</a>'s first mission: rescue <a href=\"/super-joe/3005-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-52\"> Super Joe </a>(dubbed Joseph Gibson in Rearmed) and eliminate the enemy leader.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381378-scsh396590.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381378\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381378-scsh396590.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381378\"><img alt=\"Futuristic swinging has never been so fun!\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/381378-scsh396590.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12968/381378-scsh396590.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12968/381378-scsh396590.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Futuristic swinging has never been so fun!</figcaption></figure><p>The main feature which differentiated the Bionic Commando gameplay at the time in relation to other 8-bit era platformers was the lack of a jump button. Due to the simplicity of the NES controller (two buttons) most side scrolling shooters had one jump button and one fire button (such as <a href=\"/contra/3030-4350/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4350\"> Contra</a>) however in order to differentiate the product at the time Capcom developers came up with the idea of introducing the grappling hook mechanic which, due to the limitation of the NES controller, meant the elimination altogether of the jump button.</p><p>The game still holds this easy-to-use control scheme, with little timing involved. The player is required to push B/Triangle while standing still to shoot the grappling hook diagonally, while running forward causes Rad to shoot forward, and firing up while looking up shoots it up. The hook is used to reach different platforms in the game (replacing the above mentioned jump button).</p><p>Also, Rad has the power to crouch and fire off his grappling hook at concrete barriers on the ground to slide across the floor, and grabbing a barrel lets him bring it towards himself and use it as a weapon and shield. Certain stone walls can be pulled away by using the bionic arm, and enemies can be grabbed and thrown/used as human shields when an upgrade is applied later in the game.</p><p>A new mechanic was introduced in Rearmed which was absent from the NES version of the game. In order to hack into enemy computers, Rad must shoot a ball in different directions hitting blocks, trying to get to the green block. These puzzles get more and more challenging as the game progresses, and start to incorporate such things as teleports. The A button is the shoot button and requires multiple button presses to get multiple shots off.</p><p>Another new addition is the ability to gain momentum while suspended. While players got stuck and were forced to drop down in order to shoot their arm to move again in the original title, Rearmed allows the shotgun to propel Spencer backwards to start swinging again.</p><p> </p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Nathan \"Rad\" Spencer has a wide variety of weapons in his arsenal, many of which unlock via progressing through the game's many levels. Weapons upgrade when the particular item is found in secret areas or allied bases.</p><p> </p><h3>Revolver</h3><p>The Revolver is a Standard Issue .45 with a nickname of \"Daisy.\" The single-fire pistol is able to shoot three bullets at a time when upgraded and deals minimal but effective damage.</p><p> </p><h3>Grenades</h3><p>Grenades are thrown, usually over barriers to reach crouched and hiding enemies. Holding down while throwing it drops the grenade to the platform directly beneath Spencer. They are useful for dealing with groups, machines, and unreachable foes.</p><p> </p><h3>Plasma Rifle</h3><p>The Plasma Rifle is a laser weapon that deals very little damage to human enemies, but dishes out lethal force to mechanical beings. It is most effective against patrolling robots and bosses.</p><p> </p><h3>Bazooka</h3><p>A traditional rocket launcher with varying accuracy and enormous power. A single-fire weapon, it kills most standard enemies instantly, and is lethal to the player should they be standing too close to the resulting explosion. The bazooka is upgraded in the final level of the game and allows remote control via the right analog stick (consoles) to maneuver the wayward rocket. Since it deals incredible damage, firing rockets at bosses and groups is very effective.</p><p> </p><h3>Shotgun</h3><p>The 13 gauge \"Hagle Breaker\" is essential for close combat. While useless at long range, the forceful impact of the spread will kill standard soldiers in a single shot. Shooting the shotgun while suspended from Rad's bionic arm results in momentous propulsion, giving the player a chance to swing again whereas they'd normally have to drop to whatever doom awaited below.</p><p> </p><h3>Vector Cannon</h3><p>This rebounding laser is effective against machines and humans, and is essential for reaching meticulously placed turrets or gunmen. The rebounding shot arcs at a 45 degree angle and shoots up or down depending on the player's standing/crouching stance.</p><p> </p><h3>Joe's Machine Gun</h3><p>This rapid-fire machine gun deals phenomenal damage at a high rate. Essential for quick clean ups and taking down groups, the weapon will push players backwards, if they aren't running while shooting. The weapon initially belonged to Super Joe, and is available upon his rescue.</p><p> </p><h2>Body Upgrades</h2><p> </p><h3>The Helmet, Shin Guards and Bullet Proof Vest</h3><p>The Helmet, Shin Guards and Bullet Proof Vest all allow players to take an extra hit of damage without it affecting their Hit Points. Once hit with a bullet, the respective piece of armor will degrade and fall off, as indicated by its gold logo flinging off of the character. When one is equipped, one shot is deflected; when two are equipped, two shots are equipped; when three are equipped, three shots are stopped.</p><p> </p><h3>Iron Boots</h3><p>Unlocking and equipping the Iron Boots means players that swing in to most enemies will plant their metal foot in to their face and likely kill them instantly. Some enemies are not affected by the attack, such as the bulky blue Bomb Expert, Shielded Soldiers and most bosses.</p><p> </p><h3>Health Recovery Pills</h3><p>The pills are actually a liquid that increase Rad's total health. The fact that the \"pills\" are a liquid is joked about in a dialogue between Spencer and Hayley. This is a reference to the NES version of Bionic Commando where the icon for Health Recovery Pills was also a liquid.</p><p> </p><h3>Power Claw</h3><p>The Power Claw allows Spencer to grab enemies and throw them, which immediately kills them, or use them as human shields to absorb incoming bullets. Grabbing and throwing an enemy negates any item drops such as health or bonus points.</p><p>Stand still and press B to fire a grappling hook diagonally. The main gameplay elements introduced in the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version of the game have been kept almost intact in this version of Bionic Commando.</p><p> </p><h2>Pricing and Availability</h2><p>Bionic Commando Rearmed retails for 800 Microsoft Points on Xbox Live Arcade, $9.99 on PlayStation Network, and $14.99 for the PC via digital distribution. The PSN version will be Remote Play compatible. The game is scheduled to release on August 13, 2008 (XBLA) with the PSN and PC versions following on the 14th. The list for digital distributors on the PC is yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Producer Ben Judd announced on August 13, 2008 that the PC version of Bionic Commando: Rearmed will feature additional challenge rooms included in a free patch to be released sometime after the game's release. Judd did not announce when this additional content would be released for the PC, or whether console players would have a chance to purchase this additional content. Though becoming fairly standard with digitally distributed PC titles, Bionic Commando was not released via Valve's service, Steam upon release. Capcom claimed that they could not reach agreeable terms with Valve, leaving the game to be distributed solely through Capcom's online store. However, the game has since been released on steam for $9/9€</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><b>Rad Spencer</b>: Rad Spencer is the protagonist that the p-layer assumes control of in Rearmed. He yields a bionic arm and often has many sly remarks to make about the situation at hand. Official badass.</li><li><b>Super Joe</b>: Super Joe is a super soldier who fights on the protagonists side after he has been rescued. It is also well documented that he is a badass.

The game is well-known for its <a href=\"../../multiple-endings/92-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiple endings</a>, <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">Active Time Battle</a> system, and time-spanning storyline. Before its release, Chrono Trigger was a highly anticipated collaboration between <a href=\"/squaresoft/3010-6323/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Squaresoft</a> and freelance members of <a href=\"../../enix/65-6337/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enix</a>. The development team was comprised of the same minds behind the popular RPGs Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, earning them the moniker of \"The Dream Team.\" The game has sold around 3.5 million copies worldwide across its various ports.</p><p>At the time of its release, Chrono Trigger received great praise from critics and fans. Due to the game's <a href=\"../../multiple-endings/92-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiple endings</a>, story, music (by famed Final Fantasy composers Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda), battle system, and detailed graphics, the game was so popular it sold two million copies within the first two months of release. Chrono Trigger has since been hailed as one of the greatest games of all time by various popular gaming websites and magazines (placing in the top 100 of IGN, GameSpot, and Famitsu's best games of all time features). Metacritic lists the Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger with a 92% or \"universal acclaim.\"</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The development of Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between several influential figures in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japanese </a>game development, including <a href=\"../../hironobu-sakaguchi/72-633/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> (creator of <a href=\"/squaresoft/3010-6323/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Squaresoft</a>'s <a href=\"../../final-fantasy/62-194/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Fantasy</a> series), <a href=\"../../yuji-horii/72-46276/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yuji Horii</a> (creator of <a href=\"/enix-corporation/3010-6337/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6337\">Enix</a>'s <a href=\"/dragon-quest/3025-160/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-160\">Dragon Quest</a> series), <a href=\"../../nobuo-uematsu/72-635/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nobuo Uematsu</a> (composer of the Final Fantasy series), <a href=\"../../yasunori-mitsuda/72-48573/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasunori Mitsuda</a> (composer for Chrono Trigger), and <a href=\"../../akira-toriyama/72-46277/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akira Toriyama</a> (creator of the <a href=\"../../dragon-ball/62-971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dragon Ball</a> series and longtime contributor to the <a href=\"../../dragon-quest/62-160/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dragon Quest</a> franchise).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741245-chrono_trigger.003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741245\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741245-chrono_trigger.003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741245\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741245-chrono_trigger.003.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741245-chrono_trigger.003.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741245-chrono_trigger.003.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741245-chrono_trigger.003.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Chrono Trigger was produced by <a href=\"../../kazuhiko-aoki/72-48603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kazuhiko Aoki</a> and directed by <a href=\"../../akihiko-matsui/72-48562/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akihiko Matsui</a>, <a href=\"../../yoshinori-kitase/72-634/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoshinori Kitase</a> and <a href=\"../../takashi-tokita/72-48578/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Takashi Tokita</a>. <a href=\"../../yuji-horii/72-46276/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yuji Horii</a> assisted Hironobu Sakaguchi in the supervision of the game. Yuji Horii, being a large fan of time travel, decided to center the game's plot around <a href=\"../../time-travel/92-73/\" rel=\"nofollow\">time travel</a>. Masato Kato then edited and revised the storyline, and in the process created the idea of <a href=\"../../multiple-endings/92-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiple endings</a>. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita also assisted in the writing of the script. Other designers working on the game include <a href=\"../../tetsuya-takahashi/72-16562/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tetsuya Takahashi</a>, <a href=\"../../yasuyuki-honne/72-90704/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasuyuki Honne</a>, <a href=\"../../tetsuya-nomura/72-637/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, and <a href=\"../../yusuke-naora/72-638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yusuke Naora</a>.</p><p>Hironobu Sakaguchi has talked about the development process of Chrono Trigger in a positive light. He cited humorous scenes in the game that he said would not be possible in a Final Fantasy game. He also referred to the development of Chrono Trigger as \"playing in Toriyama's universe.\" Toriyama had a large influence on the game development. For example, when Squaresoft requested a playable animal character in the game, the team based <a href=\"../../frog/94-1224/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frog</a> off of one of Toriyama's sketches.</p><p>As the game was being developed certain elements were modified from their original designs and ultimately turned into well known parts of the story. When game testers complained about the difficulty and non-linearity of the game, the team added the End of Time so that players could get hints in relation to the next goal. Some of the novel features of the game also proved to be new challenges for the development team, which necessitated extra attention. Sakaguchi required the beta testers to play through the game twice, to confirm that the <a href=\"../../new-game-plus/92-150/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Game Plus</a> feature worked.</p><p>The Famicom and Super Nintendo versions of Chrono Trigger both utilized 32 megabit cartridges that had RAM and battery backup for saving games. As the Japanese and North American versions of the game were developed on different schedules, they do contain some oddities. For example, the Japanese version contains art for the ending of the game and a running count of the amount of items in the player's inventory, and the North American version still contains an unused song for the unfinished Singing Mountain dungeon.</p><h3>Localization</h3><p><a href=\"../../ted-woolsey/72-50831/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ted Woolsey</a> (an influential figure in translation) was asked to localize the game for North America in only thirty days. He didn't have a modern translation team, so to get the context of the game he had to memorize certain scenarios and read drafts of player's guides to get a feel for the game. Despite these facts, Ted Woolsey still said that this was one of his favorite games to translate.</p><p>Localization for the North American market changed many things, mostly due to <a href=\"../../nintendo/65-90/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo of America</a>'s stricter standards at the time. References to breastfeeding, alcohol (changed to soda in the North American version), religion, and homosexuality (in the case of <a href=\"../../flea/94-5326/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flea</a>, a character who looks physically like a woman but is in reality a man) were either simplified or removed from the game entirely. Localization also changed many of the main characters' names. There are a variety of possible reasons as to why this happened, perhaps because the Japanese names did not sound exotic enough. In the case of a few names, however, there was not enough space for the name to fit using English letters as opposed to Japanese characters.</p><h3>Connection to Secret of Mana</h3><p>According to <a href=\"/hiromichi-tanaka/3040-61873/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-61873\">Hiromichi Tanaka</a> in <a href=\"http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/seikendensetsubox.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">2011</a> and <a href=\"http://legendsoflocalization.com/final-fantasy-iv-secret-of-mana-and-chrono-trigger-had-a-connection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">2013</a>, Chrono Trigger was originally planned to be what eventually became <a href=\"/secret-of-mana/3030-19507/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19507\">Secret of Mana</a>, which itself was originally intended to be <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a> and was produced by the team behind <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-21463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21463\">Final Fantasy III</a> (Hiromichi Tanaka and <a href=\"/nasir-gebelli/3040-61871/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-61871\">Nasir Gebelli</a>). In Tanaka's own words:</p><blockquote><p>After we finished FFIII, we started FFIV with the idea of a slightly more action-based, dynamic overworld rather than keep combat as a completely separate thing. But, at some point, it wound up not being IV anymore… Instead, it was eventually released as “Seiken Densetsu 2″ (Secret of Mana), but during development it was actually referred to as “Chrono Trigger”. (laugh)</p><p>At the time, just after FFIII, we were working with Mr. Toriyama on a game with a seamless, side-view system. A CD-ROM attachment for the Super Famicom was scheduled to be released, you see. So we had this enormous game planned out for the CD-ROM attachment, but ultimately we were never able to release it.</p><p>So we had the Chrono Trigger project changed to a new game, and this other game we had been working on was condensed down into Seiken Densetsu 2. Because of this, Seiken 2 always felt like a sequel to FFIII to me.</p></blockquote><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741128\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741128\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741128-chrono_trigger.075.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Chrono Trigger takes influence from many elements of traditional Japanese RPG gameplay while abandoning others. For example, it borrows familiar concepts from earlier Final Fantasy games, such as menu and turn based combat, but largely eliminates the RPG staple of random enemy encounters, instead allowing players to view enemies in the field making it possible to avoid many conflicts all together.</p><p>Another difference from previous RPGs is that actual battles do not occur on the overworld map. In Chrono Trigger battles occur in smaller exploration areas or dungeons where enemies are displayed in the environment. Aside from making encounters optional, having enemies onscreen also helps create a smoother battle transition since the characters will take battle formation in the onscreen environment instead of the game fading to a separate battle screen. The overworld serves to connect these areas with other places of interest such as town. Towns, as is usual in RPGs, contain areas where the party can rest or purchase items, weapons, and <a href=\"../../armor/93-574/\" rel=\"nofollow\">armor</a>.</p><p>Chrono Trigger was the first game to coin the term \"<a href=\"../../new-game-plus/92-150/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Game Plus</a>,\" though the actual concept had appeared in other games dating back to the original <a href=\"../../the-legend-of-zelda/61-11949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legend of Zelda</a>. After completing the game, a player can create a New Game Plus allowing him or her to retain all equipment, levels, and Techs (this game's version of special abilities.) New Game Plus also allows the player to fight <a href=\"../../lavos/94-2278/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lavos, </a>the final boss of the game, much earlier in the storyline, which is how the game's multiple endings can be unlocked.</p><p>The time travel aspect of Chrono Trigger transcends story purposes, affecting gameplay as well. Different periods of time become accessible during certain parts of the game. These eras can then be accessed through time portals or (later in the game) through a time traveling device that the party dubs \"<a href=\"../../epoch/93-299/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Epoch</a>.\" Epoch can travel to any time period instantaneously, while the time portals can only lead the player to certain areas in a time period. Side-quests available in the past time periods of the game can influence events in future areas.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741250\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741250\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/741250-chrono_trigger.091.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Chrono Trigger utilizes the <a href=\"../../active-time-battle/92-95/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Active Time Battle</a> system, a battle system popularized by the Final Fantasy series. Each character has a bar which scrolls across based on the character's speed. Once the bar is filled, it is that character's turn.</p><p>Unlike many Japanese role-playing games, there is no transition to a separate battle screen when the party encounters enemies. Instead, when a fight begins, a battle menu simply appears on the current area being traversed by the party (which can be moved between the top and the bottom of the screen). Enemies and characters aren't locked to a single grid either, as they move around the area fluidly. Depending on how the enemies and characters are placed on the field, some attacks have more effectiveness than others (for example, attacks that hit enemies grouped together).</p><p>In combat, there are three options: Attack, Item, and Tech. Attacking has the character doling out a physical attack. Items are accesible through the second option, providing buffs and healing items. Techs are special abilities that each character can use, both magical and non-magical. Each character has a base magic ability, with abilities such as Water, Lightning, or Shadow (with the exception of <a href=\"../../robo/94-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robo</a>, who is a robot and <a href=\"../../ayla/94-1270/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ayla</a>, who was born before the creation of magic). In addition to individual (or Single) Techs, there are also Double and Triple Techs which involve two and three party members, respectively. Learning a Double or Triple Tech is dependent on which Single Techs the individuals involved have learned. The Double and Triple Techs cost each party member involved a corresponding amount of MP.</p><h3>Techs</h3><p>The element of the game which makes it stand out from other RPG's of the time is the tech system. The techs work like standard magic or skills in any other RPG, however Chrono Trigger puts its own spin on things. First off, as opposed to a Final Fantasy where there are dozens of magic options for each character, in Chrono Trigger each character has 10 individual techs which are usually unique to them and their element. These are just solo techs however, a huge element of the battles are the dual and triple techs.</p><p>To unlock regular techs in the game each battle rewards the player with 3 basic things, money, experience, and tech points. Each character has their own standard of tech points that they need to reach to unlock the next solo tech. Learning dual and triple techs is done completely differently.</p><p>Dual and triple techs are techs that need either two or three party members turns to be ready. This is generally a strong move where each character performs a version of one of their own solo techs but they combine it with the other party members involved. These techs generally cost a lot of MP and have the added con of using multiple members turns at the same time for one attack.</p><p>Dual and triple techs are unlocked after playing one battle with the duo or trio in question after they have unlocked the single tech that they perform.</p><p>When the player begins their journey the first thing they are prompted to do is choose between Active mode and Wait mode. Active mode is the traditional mode which is meant to make the player feel like they are in a rush during battles. During this mode every character has their own ATB bar while the enemies have their own invisible one. When the player is selecting whatever options they want the enemy can attack them at all times.</p><p>In Wait mode the players characters can be attacked while they are waiting, however once they enter any combat menu the enemies actions freeze completely. This is an easier mode which gives the player some time to think about their actions.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190151\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.93320610687023\" data-width=\"524\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 524px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190151\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png 524w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png 524w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6974/190151-chronotriggeraction1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Chrono Trigger takes place in the kingdom of Guardia throughout several different ages, primarily 1000 AD. The game opens with Crono, the game's protagnist, waking up on the day of the Millennial Fair. At the fair, Crono meets Marle, a mysterious and bubbly girl who ends up being teleported to the past after a mishap with a time machine. Crono decides to travel back in time as well and try to save her.</p><p>Crono quickly finds that he has been teleported to the year 400 AD. This is an era in which the kingdom of Guardia is at perpetual war with the forces of an evil and powerful sorcerer named Magus.</p><p>Upon visiting Guardia Castle, he finds Marle posing as this era's queen, Queen Leene. Unfortunately, their reunion is short-lived, as Marle vanishes suddenly after revealing her identity. On the way out of the castle, Crono finds Lucca, the time machine's inventor and a close friend of Crono, who has also traveled to 400 AD to see how she can help. Lucca tells Crono how Marle is actually the princess in 1000 AD, and that Queen Leene is her ancestor. When the castle guards found Marle, they stopped the search for Leene, essentially guaranteeing her death and ending her line.</p><p>Crono and Lucca venture to a cathedral inhabited by monsters disguised as nuns. There, they meet Frog (who is actually Glenn, a knight who Magus turned into an amphibian), and manage to save the real queen as well as the chancellor. This fixes the timeline, and Crono and Lucca return home with Marle using a new device created by Lucca, the \"gate key,\" which stabilizes temporal vortexes and allows the party to traverse time using pre-existing \"gates.\"</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/248791-ct_court.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248791\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25390625\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/248791-ct_court.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248791\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/248791-ct_court.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/248791-ct_court.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/248791-ct_court.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10967/248791-ct_court.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Back in 1000 AD, Crono decides to escort Marle back to the castle.

The party navigates through a jungle maze to get the key back, ultimately encountering (and chasing away) <a href=\"../../azala/94-22199/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azala</a>, the ruler of the Reptites. During this encounter, the party learns about the advanced intelligence of the Reptites, compared to the still-primitive, barbaric human race.</p><p>They travel back to 1000 AD, and visit Melchior, who willingly repairs the Masamune. Crono and company then go back to 600 AD to find Frog, who believes he is unworthy to wield the legendary blade. After some convincing, he agrees, even traveling to the End of Time to learn magic.

Magus recognizes Frog but shows no fear in the face of the Masamune. The party defeats the sorcerer, causing his spell to go awry--Magus then reveals that he was not creating Lavos but merely summoning it so that he could defeat it.

Only Azala recognizes it for what it is: the end of the future.</p><p>Crono and friends then travel to a huge kingdom of magic in 12,000 BC. The <a href=\"../../zeal/95-1035/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingdom of Zeal</a> is a huge floating continent where humans practice magic, a long-lost technique by the time Frog's era comes around. The people of Zeal are getting all their power through the Mammon Machine, a machine that extracts Lavos' energy for their own good. While exploring Zeal, the party meets a mysterious prophet, who warns <a href=\"../../queen-zeal/94-5160/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Queen Zeal</a> about Crono's plans. A young boy also tells the party, \"One among you will shortly perish.\"</p><p>The queen exiles the party to the ground of the world, which is experiencing an Ice Age brought on by Lavos' crash-landing so many years ago.

They arrive too late, however, and Lavos then awakens. The prophet is revealed to be Magus, who attempts to destroy Lavos but is batted aside effortlessly. Lavos stuns everyone, but Crono pulls himself to his feet. He hurls himself at Lavos, but is instantly vaporized. The rest of the party wakes up in a hut on the ground of the world, which is where non-magic users have lived. During the confusion, an advisor to Queen Zeal named <a href=\"../../dalton/94-3622/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dalton</a> has stolen the Wings of Time (now the \"Aero Dalton Imperial\"), and has declared himself ruler of the world.</p><p>When Frog wakes up, he goes outside and confronts Magus, who cursed him in the first place. Magus, for his part, is cocky, even insulting Crono and calling him weak for trying to stop Lavos. The player is given a choice: let Magus live or kill him and break the curse on Frog. If the player lets him live, he joins the party. The party goes to defeat Dalton, who imprisons them and requires a daring break-out, before being easily defeated. At the end of time, it is revealed that Magus was the mysterious prophet, and he only wanted to summon Lavos to kill it. It is revealed that the old man is a Guru named Gaspar. He informs the party of an egg called the Chrono Trigger, which they can use to resurrect Crono.</p><p>At this point in the game, it is up to the player to save Crono or not. The main story is technically over aside from the final confrontation, a series of optional side quests open up, and resurrecting Crono is optional.</p><p>If the player decides to revive Crono, Gaspar suggests that they visit <a href=\"../../belthasar/94-10563/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Belthasar</a> in 2300 AD. He knows the secret to bringing someone back from the dead. Belthasar tells them that Death Peak (also located in 2300 AD) is the key to reviving their downed comrade. However, there are two requirements: the need for Crono needs to be incredibly great and they will need an exact replica of him (which can be obtained from a magician in 1000 AD). After getting the replica, and visiting the top of Death Peak, Crono can be revived.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776542-cro_2a_95.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-776542\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776542-cro_2a_95.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-776542\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776542-cro_2a_95.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776542-cro_2a_95.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776542-cro_2a_95.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776542-cro_2a_95.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Naturally, only one ending is considered canon. In this ending, the party reaches Lavos and manages to destroy its outer protective shell (either through fighting or crashing Epoch into it). Here, it is revealed that Lavos has been using the planet by harvesting DNA to control its evolution. It then proceeds to take on a final form, which is quickly destroyed by the team.</p><p>The game then goes to a celebratory traditional ending at the end of the Millennial Fair. Crono and his friends all say goodbye and return to their respective eras via the time gates.

Frog travels into Magus' Castle to unleash his revenge upon Magus. As Frog unsheathes his sword, the scene cuts to a cloaked figure.

The ending starts off just as the game does, with a bell ringing and Crono's mom waking him up. The major difference, however, is the fact that all of the character sprites are Reptites. Since the party never defeated Azala from his reign of terror, the intelligent Reptite race gains dominance over humans.</p><h3>Magus' Revenge</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822603-cromag_19.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822603\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822603-cromag_19.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822603\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822603-cromag_19.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822603-cromag_19.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822603-cromag_19.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822603-cromag_19.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>There are two possible ways to receive this ending. The first is to defeat Lavos after defeating Azala in Tyran Castle, but before watching Schala use her magic pendant to open the sealed door in Zeal Palace. The second way is to defeat Lavos after being thrown out of the Zeal Kingdom, but before making it through the Ocean Palace. The ending shows Magus walking alone in scenes that the party has been through in the game, on his own personal quest of revenge: defeat Lavos once and for all.</p><h3>Girl Chat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776545-crogirl_41.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-776545\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776545-crogirl_41.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-776545\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776545-crogirl_41.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776545-crogirl_41.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776545-crogirl_41.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/776545-crogirl_41.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>To receive this ending, Lavos must be defeated after seeing Schala use her magic pendant to open the sealed door in Zeal, but before getting Marle's pendant charged.

In order to get this particular ending, the party cannot crash Epoch into Lavos. After Crono's death (and also Magus' death), everybody goes to their respective time period through the time gates. The remaining party members ends up at the Millennial Fair, with Frog being a human again. The remaining members set out to search for Crono. If Magus is still alive, then this ending is essentially the same, except Frog is still a frog.</p><p>In another version of this ending, Lavos must be defeated after Crono's death, except the party must crash Epoch into Lavos. This ending is essentially the same as the other version of this ending except for the fact that all of the characters stay behind to go on a search through time for Crono. This ending is slightly different if the player has the Chrono Trigger and if the player saved Lara. If Magus is killed, Frog will still be a frog (unlike in the other version of this ending).</p><h3>Dream's Epilogue</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879220\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74946466809422\" data-width=\"467\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 467px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879220\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png 467w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png 467w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/879220-ct_dreamsdevourer.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>This ending was added in the DS version of Chrono Trigger. To get this ending, Lavos must be defeated after completing the Dimensional Vortex. Then, a new bucket will appear at the End of Time, called the Time's Eclipse. By going here, the party will meet Magus (regardless of whether he is in the party or not). He will offer to fight and flee, but will transform into the Dream's Devourer, who is controlling Schala.</p><p>Upon defeating the Dream's Devourer, the party is blown away and Magus and Schala talk. Then, Magus is warped to a forest and apparently loses his memory. He leaves to try and regain it. This is when the PlayStation cut scene plays about the loss of the Masamune. By doing this ending, Crono also gets a new sword, the Dreamseeker, which has a 90% critical hit rate.</p><h3>Game Over</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822606\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822606\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822606-chronot6_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Not technically a good ending to get, but in this ending, the only necessity is to be defeated by Lavos.

Chrono Resurrection is an unreleased fan remake of several scenes from the game. Many high-profile game critics complimented the ambition of the project, and noted the professionalism of the project. However, Resurrection was halted when a cease and desist letter arrived from Square Enix, requesting that production be stopped.</p><p>Another similar project that was halted in mid-development was more ambitious; it sought to remake the entire game. This project was known as Chrono Trigger Remake Project until it was shut down due to a cease and desist letter from Square Enix.</p><p>Several other fan projects were shut down by Square Enix, many of which originated on Chrono fan-site Chrono Compendium. On May 8, 2009, Square Enix sent a cease and desist to the website for their Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes project, as well as requesting that the website remove information on other fan projects and ROM hacks: Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile, Chrono Trigger Retranslation, Chrono Trigger Re-amped, Chrono Trigger Rebirth, and Chrono Trigger Azala Style.</p><p>Chrono Trigger has since had two sequels: <a href=\"../../radical-dreamers-nusumenai-houseki/61-11566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hoseki</a> and <a href=\"../../chrono-cross/61-4328/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chrono Cross</a>. Radical Dreamers was only released in Japan, but Chrono Cross was released worldwide for the PlayStation. Square Enix applied for the trademark Chrono Break in 2001, which has caused many fans to speculate about the possibility of the series continuing.</p><h3>Prerelease Versions</h3><p>There are two known prerelease versions (an alpha and a beta). The beta version has been leaked onto the internet and even translated into English. The alpha version was shown in preview videos and screenshots. Differences include an extra door in 600 AD Guardia Castle, paler guard sprites, no spikes in Crono's hair, five levels of elemental power (opposed to just one), large overworld differences, rough musical tracks, a slightly altered Epoch sprite, altered dialogue, changed door seal design, and a slightly different Arris Dome.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962786-epoch__ctp_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962786\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.10629921259843\" data-width=\"254\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 254px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:10.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962786-epoch__ctp_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962786\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-width=\"254\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962786-epoch__ctp_.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962786-epoch__ctp_.png 254w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962786-epoch__ctp_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962786-epoch__ctp_.png 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-width=\"254\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The beta version, having been released onto the internet in ROM format, has much more information surrounding it. Known as the prerelease version (rather than beta), it is dated November 17, 1994, and was sent to reviewers and retailers to give a sample of what Chrono Trigger was before it was released. The prerelease is not a complete game. There are barriers blocking the way in Guardia Castle, Lab 32, and Magic Cave. By using location offsets, however, the player can access much more of the game. Location offsets are two digit hexadecimal codes that can be used with the code 7E0100XX (XX being the location offset). There are two other ways to access other areas in the game. The first is to use saved games in an emulator. The last way is to use the Epoch, which despite having a different sprite is completely functional in the prerelease. There are areas where the player can't access, but these are all places that aren't usually accessible via the Epoch. The Epoch sprite is likely one of the most different sprite in the prerelease (as other sprites have minor changes and palette swaps as opposed to large differences).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962787-map_sprites_pre.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962787\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"128\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 128px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962787-map_sprites_pre.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-962787\"><img alt=\"The guard overworld sprite is located at the bottom; it is believed to have been a barrier.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" data-width=\"128\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962787-map_sprites_pre.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962787-map_sprites_pre.png 128w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The guard overworld sprite is located at the bottom; it is believed to have been a barrier.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962787-map_sprites_pre.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/962787-map_sprites_pre.png 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" data-width=\"128\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The guard overworld sprite is located at the bottom; it is believed to have been a barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>It has been long-rumored that Schala was a playable character in a prerelease version of Chrono Trigger. By examining the data in the ROM, it has been determined that this rumor is false. Not only are there no extra sprites for Schala (most importantly, no overworld sprites), there is not an eighth character slot and Schala's graphics are compressed (like all other non-playable characters, and unlike the decompressed graphics of the playable characters). If a playable character did have compressed graphics, it would give the game huge slowdown because the CPU would have to decompress the graphics during gameplay.</p><p>Additionally, there is a guard overworld sprite in the overworld sprite data. At first, it was rumored to be an eighth character, but after analyzing non-playable character data, it has been found that the overworld sprite was likely a barrier to prevent the player from progressing, but was removed as the developers found a way to use the environment as a barrier instead. There are many other minor differences, mostly related to minor graphical, dialogue, and sound changes.</p><h3>DS Version</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822706\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.609375\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822706\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/822706-chronotriggerds280_screen.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger was released on November 25, 2008 in North America, November 20, 2008 in Japan, and February 6, 2009 in Europe. This version adds many new features, but retains the gameplay and graphical style. The game features an all-new translation, the anime cut scenes of the PlayStation remake, and several new gameplay modes.</p><p>The game can be played in either one of two modes: DS Mode and Classic Mode. DS Mode features touch-screen controls, while Classic Mode is the original game. New dungeons have been added as well, including Dimensional Vortex and Lost Sanctum. The Lost Sanctum is an area where the player can go for various side quests that can be done for items and money. These dungeons also contain new bosses, and in the case of Dimensional Vortex, a new final boss and a new ending. The graphics have been slightly altered, adding new sprites and animations in some cases.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/753947-ctss_01.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-753947\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/753947-ctss_01.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-753947\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/753947-ctss_01.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/753947-ctss_01.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/753947-ctss_01.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/753947-ctss_01.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Arena is a completely new mode in this version of the game.

Then, the player can send the creature into an area that has already been visited for training. Items for these creatures can be bought from a Nu merchant in the arena. Additionally, other non-playable characters' creatures can be fought using a trained Smidge.</p><p>An Extras section has been added with various items, and a few hidden ones.

The rumors were partially true. An anime based on Chrono Trigger did exist, but it was a one episode special. The special was made in 1996 for a V-Jump convention. Titled Time and Space Adventures - Nuumamonjaa, the episode was sixteen minutes long. It followed a Nu and a Poyozo doll as they attempted to sell wares at a monster version of the Millennial Fair.</p><p>A short manga was in the Japanese Chrono Trigger player's guide. Only ten pages long, it was a brief and comedic story following Crono. In the manga, he meets Marle and samples Lucca's teleportation device. The story ended quickly, although it was merely meant to be an introduction to the game. Another short manga was created that was essentially a manga version of the Chrono Trigger original animation video. It ran for several issues in the <em>V-Jump</em> magazine around and after Chrono Trigger's release. In addition, the magazine featured other specials relating to Chrono Trigger, most notably a large 3D model of Robo.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-779124\" data-ratio=\"1.534\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-779124\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg 417w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/779124-jp_07.jpg 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Chrono Trigger, considering its popularity, had many guides released covering the game. Naturally, there was the Official Player's Guide from <em>Nintendo Power</em> (that was also used as a subscription bonus to <em>Nintendo Power</em>). Two other guides were published in Japan. Chrono Trigger: The Perfect is notable due to the fact that it contained much more information beyond that of a regular guide.</p><p>This guide contained interviews from Yuji Horii and Hironobu Sakaguchi, two well-known developers who worked on the game. The second Japanese guide was Chrono Trigger Super Famicom Player's Guide, which contained the short manga based on Chrono Trigger (detailed above). Other than that, it was a traditional guide.</p><p>Much more official merchandise was created for promotion of Chrono Trigger. Prior to the release of Chrono Trigger, many \"prism cards\" were released that showed scenes and characters from the game. These cards are especially notable for their depictions of scenes that differ from the actual game (showing insight on the game's development and prerelease versions).</p><p>In addition, many of the cards had \"mockups,\" which are scenes that the developers created for promotional purposes, and do not actually appear in the game. The cards were holographic, making them difficult to spread on the internet (as noted by Chrono Compendium, which has images of all of the cards). Other merchandise for Chrono Trigger includes bookmarks (released to promote the PlayStation rerelease) and keychains (also released of Chrono Cross, possibly sold at arcades prior to the games' releases).</p><h2>Fan Remakes, Rom Hacks, and Rereleases</h2><p>Chrono Trigger had two popular rereleases which each added their own content. The first of the two was on Playstation in 2001. The game was rereleased on a disc collection entitled <a href=\"/final-fantasy-chronicles/3030-14455/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14455\">Final Fantasy Chronicles</a> which contained a rerelease of Chrono Trigger with an added animated ending and a series of animated cutscenes throughout the game, and a rerelease of <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a> with 3D cutscenes.</p><p>In 2009 Chrono Trigger was rereleased again on the Nintendo DS. This version included the anime cutscenes added in the 2001 rerelease as well as having a whole new battle mode and introducing a new extra dungeon. In addition to this, the game also changed its visual format to use the most potential of the Nintendo DS' dual screens. In battle the menu options are on the bottom screen while the top screen shows the entirety of the battlefield along with the characters involved in the battle.</p><p>The Playstation rerelease version has become the defacto version in any new rereleases of the game.</p><p>The fanbase of Chrono Trigger also spawned multiple ROM hacks in an attempt to followup the story. The two most popular of which are Crimson Echoes and Flames of Eternity.</p><p>Crimson Echoes acts as its own standalone plot, with a story mode that can take almost as long as the original game to complete. The game features all of the same characters returning together again to defeat a whole new evil with time travel. One of the additional positives about this game is that it takes the player to times that are different than the time periods they visit in the original game.</p><p>Since the games official release in 2009 there has been a large market online of people writing the ROM to blank carts, putting labels on them and selling them as individual SNES cartridges.</p><p>Soundtrack</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/198902-mitsuda_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198902\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.11\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/198902-mitsuda_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198902\"><img alt=\"Yasunori Mitsuda \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/198902-mitsuda_01.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/198902-mitsuda_01.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yasunori Mitsuda \" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/198902-mitsuda_01.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1665/198902-mitsuda_01.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yasunori Mitsuda </figcaption></figure><p>Chrono Trigger's music was composed by <a href=\"../../yasunori-mitsuda/72-48573/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yasunori Mitsuda</a> and Nobuo Uematsu.

It is the sequel to <a href=\"/super-mario-kart/3030-19071/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19071\">Super Mario Kart</a> for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> and features characters and track locations from the Mario universe. Mario Kart 64 made the leap from <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> to full 3D computer graphics, which allowed for complex track designs. The characters, however, remain 2-dimensional sprites. The game was a huge success, selling millions of copies and eventually became a Player's Choice title.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216925\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-216925\"><img alt=\"Bowser in Mario Kart 64\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/216925-mario_kart_64.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Bowser in Mario Kart 64</figcaption></figure><p>At its most bare-bones, Mario Kart 64 only requires the player to press the accelerate button to drive and use the analog control stick to control the kart's direction. More experienced players will be able to use <a href=\"/drifting/3015-74/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-74\">drifting</a> and Mario themed weapons and items such as <a href=\"/koopa/3015-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-120\">Turtle Shells</a> and <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">Mushroom Boosts</a> to get the advantage over their opponents. Items are scattered in rainbow colored boxes across each track and as the items in each box are random and potentially very powerful, they add a certain level of uncertainty to each race. The drifting mechanic is performed by hopping and turning in mid air which allows a player to take sharp turns without losing speed, and if done correctly one can obtain a speed boost.</p><p>The game is separated into four play types, <a href=\"/grand-prix/3015-3962/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3962\">Grand Prix</a>, Versus, Battle, and <a href=\"/time-trials/3015-1361/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1361\">Time Trial</a>. In each of these modes the player chooses from 16 race tracks and 8 playable racers, each of which have different attributes such as speed, acceleration, and weight. These attributes affect how each character handles. The Grand Prix mode has four difficulties, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Extra, each progressively faster with more difficult opponents, or in the case of Extra, mirrored versions of all of the tracks. The 16 tracks are divided into 4 cups, and the player is tasked with racing these cups to win trophies. If they achieve all gold trophies in all the cups in each difficulty, they are rewarded with a new title screen. Versus and Battle mode allow players to compete with up to four of their friends via split screen. Versus allows friends to race together on any of the single player tracks, and battle allow players to fight in large arenas using items. Time Trial has a player racing against the clock. This mode will display a \" ghost\" of the best time, which is a translucent recording of the previous best lap.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The playable characters by category are:</p><h3>Lightweight</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/toad/3005-845/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\">Toad</a></li><li><a href=\"/peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\">Princess Peach</a></li><li><a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a></li></ul><h3>Middleweight</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a></li><li><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a></li></ul><h3>Heavyweight</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a></li><li><a href=\"/wario/3005-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24\">Wario</a></li><li><a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a></li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-235050\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-235050\"><img alt=\"Player select screen\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/601/235050-21377.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/601/235050-21377.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/601/235050-21377.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Player select screen\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/601/235050-21377.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/601/235050-21377.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/601/235050-21377.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/601/235050-21377.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Player select screen</figcaption></figure><p>Lightweight racers have quick acceleration and excellent handling, but have slow top speeds and are easily knocked around.

Mario Kart Wii ships with the Wii Wheel, a plastic shell designed to hold the Wii Remote and act as a unique gimmick control for the game, which went through at least 30 different iterations before a final design was decided upon. Another \"new feature\" is the removal of a feature previously added in <a href=\"/mario-kart-double-dash/3030-18757/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18757\">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a>, which was the addition of unique items for each character; since these weapons are now gone, all the characters in the same weight category play identically, creating a less dynamic, more homogeneous race experience.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p>In Mario Kart Wii, there are four standard mode of gameplay. With the exception of Time Trials and Grand Prix which only holds one person, all modes can be played in local multiplayer with up to four people at once.</p><h3>Grand Prix</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1252055\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56088560885609\" data-width=\"813\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 813px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1252055\"><img alt=\"Toadette is ready to go as the countdown to the GP race is about to begin.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg 813w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Toadette is ready to go as the countdown to the GP race is about to begin.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg 813w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70944/1252055-1056221_mushroom_gorgec.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Toadette is ready to go as the countdown to the GP race is about to begin.</figcaption></figure><p>The standard single-player Mario Kart mode. Here, players compete in races facing 11 CPU opponents at once, a step up of four from previous Mario Kart games which maxed out at seven opponents per race. There are four modes of competition: 50cc (<a href=\"/go-kart/3055-552/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-552\">Karts</a> only), 100cc (Bikes only), 150cc, and <a href=\"/mirror-mode/3015-2975/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2975\">Mirror Mode</a> - the last of which only opens up when a player completes all circuits of all previous classes. Players can also switch the first two classes to Karts and Bikes once they beat all the circuits. As always in every <a href=\"/grand-prix/3015-3962/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3962\">GP</a> mode, players start the first race of the cup at the back of the <a href=\"/starting-grid/3015-3028/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3028\">grid</a> and just like in <a href=\"/mario-kart-ds/3030-6539/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6539\">Mario Kart DS</a>, players can <a href=\"/rocket-start/3015-1823/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1823\">rocket start</a> by pressing the gas button during the countdown before the green light on <a href=\"/lakitu/3005-927/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-927\">Lakitu</a>'s <a href=\"/lakitus-start-signal/3055-1987/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1987\">signal</a> goes off. The key to winning the mode is to use items and claim first place after all three <a href=\"/laps/3015-1202/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1202\">laps</a> are played. With more racers, the point system has increased. First place gives the player fifteen points, twelve for second place, ten for third, and so forth. After all four races are played, an award ceremony is being held for the three best drivers and players are given a ranking from E to 3 Stars in addition to the trophy for winning the cup.</p><h3>Time Trials</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-966472\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75050709939148\" data-width=\"493\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 493px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-966472\"><img alt=\"A Time Trial run at Rainbow Road with Mario.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg 493w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Time Trial run at Rainbow Road with Mario.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg 493w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/966472-mk4_156.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Time Trial run at Rainbow Road with Mario.</figcaption></figure><p>Here players compete for the fastest time possible in each course.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tetris: The Grand Master (abbreviated TGM) is a <a href=\"/tetris/3025-291/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-291\">Tetris</a> game that was developed by <a href=\"/arika-co-ltd/3010-328/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-328\">Arika</a> and released in 1998. In many ways, it can be considered a spiritual successor to <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a>'s Tetris, which appeared in Japanese arcades in 1988. TGM inherits many defining traits from Sega's game and builds upon that core with new mechanics refinements and challenges.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Rotation</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">TGM adopts Sega's simple yet effective rotation tables. With the exception of the red I-piece, every pieces are always kept level when rotated (i.e. aligned with the bottom of the bounding box); this helps ensure a piece can rotate cleanly on the surface of the stack, which is crucial when the game reaches the highest fall speeds.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One addition to the rotation system comes in the form of wallkicks: if the piece collides with something when rotating, the game tries to nudge the piece one cell to the right or one cell to the left (in that order) before failing to rotate. There are a few exceptions where wallkicks will not be applied:</p><ol><li>for I or O pieces.</li><li>for L/J/T pieces, if the center column of the piece will be blocked after rotation.</li><li>when using Initial Rotation (see below).</li></ol><h3>Game flow</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like Sega Tetris, TGM features a brief <em>entry delay</em> before each piece appears that can be used to prepare the next move. By holding left or right during this period, the player can \"warm up\" or <em>charge</em> movement so the next piece will enter the playfield moving full speed. The player may also \"pre-rotate\" (or <em>Initial Rotate</em>) the piece once by holding the desired rotation button until the piece appears.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">TGM maintains the quick piece movement speed afforded in Sega Tetris. After holding left/right for a brief, quarter-second delay, the piece continues moving at a rate of one unit per frame (or, <em>1 </em><i>G)</i>. Holding down to drop a piece also moves at the rate of 1G.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another crucial feature inherited from Sega is <em>lock delay</em>. Whereas most other early Tetris games would lock pieces into place as soon as they touched the ground, Sega allowed a half-second delay before the piece locked. This allowed Sega Tetris to offer challenging yet playable 1G fall speeds, where other games shied away or relegated it to use as a kill-screen. TGM continues in these footsteps and pushes beyond into new frontiers -- 2G, 3G, 5G, and even 20G (i.e., max gravity or instant drop) fall speeds are achieved.</p><h3>Levels</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unlike many other <em>Tetris</em> games, progress is not solely tied to the number of lines cleared. Instead, the level counter increases by one for every piece placed or line cleared. As a result, game speed can gradually change as the player continues to place pieces, even if they are not necessarily clearing lines. (In another nod to Sega Tetris, at one or two level checkpoints the speed will actually drop to give the player a short breather rather than relentlessly continue to speed up.)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the end of each <em>section</em> of 100 lines, the player must clear a line to progress to the next. (i.e., if the player reaches the <em>level stop</em> at 99, the counter will not continue to increase until a line is cleared.)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At level 500, the fall speed plateaus at 20G. The player must continue to endure the restrictions of max gravity play and reach level 999 to complete the game.</p><h3>Time Attack</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another divergence from typical Tetris norms is a shift in focus to speed rather than just score. While earning points does play a key role in achieving some of the game's main goals, it does not directly impact one's position on a machine's leaderboard - instead, a player's ranking is determined by a combination of grade (see more on Grades below) and how quickly they achieved it. Once players have filled the game's ranking with Grand Master performances, earning a high score becomes a matter of racing to complete the game the quickest</p><h3>Scoring</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Points are scored whenever lines are cleared. A few factors determine the value of the line clear:</p><ul><li>number of lines cleared - as usual, scoring four line clears (or tetrises) is the most lucrative, triple and double line clears are moderately valued, and single line clears earn a pittance.</li><li>current level - point values gradually and linearly increase throughout the game.</li><li>number of rows the piece was forced by holding down.</li><li>combo bonus for continuing to clear lines with consecutive pieces.</li><li><em>Bravo</em> bonus - 4x multiplier for performing a \"perfect clear\" removing all blocks from the playfield.</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, as earning points alone is not the core focus of the game, so it's not strictly necessary to employ more complex scoring methods; playing quickly and making tetrises will earn a sufficient number of points to achieve endgame goals.</p><h3>Grades</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another new feature is the Grade Recognition System. The player is awarded grades for passing certain score milestones or meeting other criteria. The player starts at grade 9 when the game begins and works their way up. The scale ranges from 9 to 1, S1 to S9, and finally the title of Grand Master (or GM). The player must meet various conditions throughout the game:</p><ul><li>achieve grade 1 and level 300 within 4 minutes 15 seconds.</li><li>achieve grade S4 and level 500 within 7 minutes 30 seconds.</li><li>earn at least 126,000 points and finish the game within 13 minutes 30 seconds.</li></ul>",

This world was once a Sacred Realm until Ganon arrived and used the <a href=\"/triforce/3055-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-18\">Triforce</a> to bend the realm to his will, covering the land with darkness and despair. Throughout the course of the game, Link must travel between the Light World and the Dark World in order to complete certain puzzles and progress through the game's story. Some areas of the Light and Dark worlds are identical, but others have minute differences that alter Link's ability to travel through them. At first, Link is transformed into a reflection of his inner self whenever entering the Dark World, which leaves him unable to use items or wield a sword and shield, but eventually he collects an item that allows him to maintain his form while traveling through the Dark World (much to the surprise of the world's natural inhabitants).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-459118\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.71701112877583\" data-width=\"629\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 629px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-459118\"><img alt=\"World Map of the Light World.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 629w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"World Map of the Light World.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 629w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/459118-zelda_map.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>World Map of the Light World.</figcaption></figure><p>About half of the game takes place in the Light World. Link must win three pendants in order to obtain the Master Sword, as well as defeat Agahnim at the top of Hyrule Castle. Most of the second half of the game takes place in the Dark World, where Link must revisit the seven <a href=\"/temple/3035-1263/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1263\">temples</a> which differ from their Light World counterparts significantly. While traversing the Dark World dungeons, it is sometimes necessary to travel to the Light World to <a href=\"/physics-manipulation/3015-88/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-88\">manipulate</a> an object, and then return to the Dark World where a consequence of that manipulation will allow Link to progress further. An example of this can be found when traversing the Dark World's water temple, as Link must first open two flood switches in the Light World's counterpart in order to allow him to venture further.</p><p>While this \" <a href=\"/parallel-worlds/3015-595/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-595\">parallel world</a>\" mechanic made its first appearance in Link to the Past, it certainly wasn't the last Zelda game to use it. <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/3030-19467/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19467\">Twilight Princess</a> both included the ability to travel between parallel worlds, and many believe that this mechanic played a significant role in the success of each of these Zelda games.</p><p>The structure of the game adheres to the formula of the series, of which this game is the prime example. Exploration of the towns and <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a> is broken up by dungeon exploration, which involves solving puzzles and facing enemies, including a <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss</a> and a <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">miniboss</a>. In each dungeon, Link will find a new item that will allow him to solve puzzles or reach new areas, while also providing a key role in besting that dugeon's boss.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><h3><a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">Swords</a></h3><ul><li>Fighters Sword</li><li>Master Sword</li><li>Tempered Sword</li><li>Golden Sword</li></ul><h3><a href=\"/shield/3055-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-87\">Shields</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872662-tunicgreen_large.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-872662\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.316091954023\" data-width=\"174\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 174px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872662-tunicgreen_large.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-872662\"><img alt=\"Link's tunic\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px\" data-width=\"174\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872662-tunicgreen_large.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872662-tunicgreen_large.gif 174w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link's tunic\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872662-tunicgreen_large.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/872662-tunicgreen_large.gif 174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px\" data-width=\"174\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link's tunic</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The Blue Shield protects against arrows and rocks.

It was released in the United States on December 1, 1988. Originally, the game was only released on the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom Disk System</a> in Japan, and was converted in format to an NES cartridge game for American and European audiences.</p><p>As was the case for the original release of the first Legend of Zelda, Zelda II's original North American release used special gold-colored catridges. Across all territories, the game sold 4.8 million copies. Zelda II has since been rereleased on a variety of platforms in both physical and digital format, including the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a>, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a>.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Franchise Influence</h2><p>Though many specifics of the game's format have not been used in the franchise since, it has had a strong influence on the franchise with elements it introduced. It was the first game in the series to feature towns houses that can be explored, and NPCs also have a much more expanded role and play a pivotal role in Link's journey. Zelda II is also the first game in the series to feature a proper magic system with a separate gauge used to measure Link's magical reserves.</p><p>Perhaps the most unique element of Zelda II is its side-scrolling action perspective. Sides-scrolling gameplay has not played a major role in the franchise since its use in this title, save for two of the three <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cd-i/3045-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-27\">Philips CD-i</a> Zelda titles produced without Nintendo's involvement. However, sidescrolling elements would later be reused in a minor way in some of the handheld Zelda adventures.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overworld</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511932\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511932\"><img alt=\"The overworld.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The overworld.</figcaption></figure><p>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link eschews the gameplay format of the original <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">Legend of Zelda</a>, and no entry in the series has played like it since. While it keeps a top-down perspective for the overworld, combat does not directly take place from this viewpoint. Like many RPGs, the overworld perspective is used for travel throughout Hyrule, from town to town and dungeon to dungeon.</p><p>The overworld is broken down into segments which initially cannot be traversed until Link is able to acquire the appropriate item. For example, some routes are blocked by impassable boulders that cannot be circumvented in the early portions of the game. However, after Link acquires the hammer, he is gains the ability to smash boulders, clearing these paths. In this way, the game keeps a sense of linearity where most dungeons need to be completed in a certain order so that the appropriate item can be obtained.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Sidescrolling and Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511968\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511968\"><img alt=\"Link takes on a dungeon boss.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link takes on a dungeon boss.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link takes on a dungeon boss.</figcaption></figure><p>When in the overworld, the player will find towns and caves to enter and explore, as well as roving icons representing monster encounters. When entering a town, dungeon, or a monster battle, the perspective shifts from overhead to a 2-D sidescrolling viewpoint in which Link is able to move left and right, jump, crouch, swing his sword, and guard using his shield.

Each time Link levels up, he is able to spend experience points to upgrade one of three stats; his attack power, his magic gauge, or his health gauge.

When Link dies, either by running out of health or falling into a pit, he will restart at the entrance to the current screen. However, when Link has lost all of his lives, the game is over and the player has to restart from the North Castle; the starting point of the game. Extra lives in the form of small Link dolls can be found in secret locations around the world.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Magic Spells</h3><p>The Adventure of Link was the first game in the series to feature a magic system. It is also the first game that provides Link with a list of spells, as well as a magic gauge that governs their usage. Similar to other role-playing games, any time Link uses a magic spell, it drains energy from the magic gauge. Link learns new spells as he travels, acquiring them from the wise men in each of the towns he visits on his quest. These spells don't come easy, however, as Link often has to complete side quests that involve such tasks as retrieving items and killing monsters before the wise men will teach him their spells. Many of the spells in the game are integral to the game's progress, such as the Jump spell that temporarily boosts Link's maximum jump height, or the Fairy spell that transforms Link into a small, flying fairy capable of crossing long gaps and chasms.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Set after the original Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link revolves around Link's quest to remove a curse placed upon <a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Princess Zelda</a>. When her father the king passed away, the <a href=\"/triforce/3055-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-18\">Triforce</a> was supposed to go to Zelda’s brother, the prince. However, the king, unsure of his son's true nature, had instead told Zelda the location of the final piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage. The prince, eventually learning of this from a wizard, goes to Zelda, demanding to know the location of the Triforce of Courage, but Zelda refuses to tell him. The wizard casts a spell on the princess, causing her to sleep forever unless the full Triforce is recovered, but passes away before the prince can convince him to undo the spell. Realizing his error, the grief-stricken prince keeps Princess Zelda in the North Castle, where she is to sleep until her curse can be lifted. He also decreed that henceforth all princesses in Hyrule would be named Zelda.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-528810\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-528810\"><img alt=\"Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Following Link's triumph over Ganon in the original game, Ganon’s minions are in a state of unrest, as his spirit still remains, but needs Link’s blood in order to come back to life. After Link learns of the curse placed upon Princess Zelda, he sets out to recover the Triforce of Courage. By doing so, he can destroy Ganon once and for all, bring peace back to Hyrule, and rouse Princess Zelda from her eternal sleep.</p><p>Link's quest takes him across Hyrule and into six different palaces, acquiring items and spells to help him along the way. Upon entering the final dungeon, Link is forced to once again fight the spirit of Ganon. However, even with Ganon defeated and the Triforce of Courage in sight, Link has one more trial he must overcome.

In northern Ukuku Prairie is the photo shop, where Link can have his photo taken. Once this has happened, the photo will be placed in the player's very own photo album, entitled \"The Travels of Link.\" From then on the photographer will appear to take photos of various events throughout the game, each of which will be added to the album. These photographs can then be printed off using the Game Boy Printer.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are a total of thirteen photographs in the game, however only twelve can be collected in a given playthrough as the first photograph contains a choice depending on whether or not Link is a willing participant in the photograph. As some of the photographs are of specific scripted events or have specific prerequisites, they can be missed entirely if the player has not obtained the photo album yet, e.g. the photo of Link opening the gate to Kanalet Castle.</p><h2>Virtual Console release</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On 7th/8th May 2011 (the year of Zelda's 25th anniversary), Link's Awakening DX was released on the 3DS <a href=\"/3dsware/3045-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">eshop</a> as part of it's <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> line-up. As with all Virtual Console releases, this is an exact, complete version of the original cart with no added content or 3D enhancements (though the Game Boy Printer is not compatible with this version). As with all Virtual Console titles, the player has the ability to create restore points when quitting the game, allowing the player to begin right from where they left off at the start of the next play session. Link's Awakening DX is priced at $5.99 in the US, £5.40 in the UK and $9 in AU.</p>",

At the outset, Cadence has her heart stolen by the NecroDancer and must battle the hordes of monsters under his control in order to retrieve it. The game reveals Cadence's and her family's history with the crypt in <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a> and <a href=\"/flashback/3015-226/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-226\">flashbacks</a>, as she progresses down the crypt.</p><p>The player must time their movements and attacks to the beat of the game's soundtrack. The game makes use of only four keys to control the character (for up, down, left and right). Combinations of movement keys are used for the player's inventory of usable items and spells. A <a href=\"/dance-dance-revolution/3025-127/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-127\">DDR</a> dance pad may be used as a controller, with a specific game mode tailored to train with it. The more the player moves to the beat without mistake, the higher the score multiplier will be.</p><p>The game was initially released on <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a>, and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> on April 23, 2015. It was later ported and re-released on the <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">Vita</a> on February 2, 2016, and then to the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> (including <a href=\"/apple-tv/3045-159/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-159\">tvOS</a>) on July 1, 2016.</p><p>A <a href=\"/prequel/3015-319/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-319\">prequel</a> <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC</a> called Crypt of the NecroDancer: AMPLIFIED was announced to go into <a href=\"/pre-release-public-testing/3015-7541/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7541\">Steam Early Access</a> on January 24, 2017. It will feature a new protagonist, an entire new zone, and more content for the game.</p><h2>Modes</h2><p>Crypt of the NecroDancer features several game modes:</p><h4>Normal Mode</h4><p>Playing the game one zone at a time. When a zone is beaten, the player is returned to the lobby with the next one is unlocked. Players can earn diamonds in this mode, which can be used to unlock items, upgrades, and manipulate which items appear in the next normal mode run.</p><h4>Local Co-op</h4><p>A second player can play alongside the first in this mode. Every player gets their own inventory, but gold is shared. Everyone moves to the same beat.</p><h4>All Zones Mode</h4><p>Also known as <a href=\"/hardcore-mode/3015-7201/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7201\">Hardcore Mode</a>. Every item is unlocked, and every character always starts with a specific number of hearts and equipment. Everyone starts from the Zone 1 Level 1, and progresses through all zones through the final boss. A <a href=\"/speedrun/3015-179/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-179\">speedrun</a> timer and a low-percent run indicator is also available in this mode. (Low-percent means not picking up any items in the game.) An option to manually seed the dungeon generation algorithm is also available.</p><h4>Daily Challenge Mode</h4><p>Similar to the All Zones Mode, but everyone gets the same seed for the day and only one chance to get on the leaderboards.</p><h4>Story Mode</h4><p>Play through all zones with Cadence, Melody, and Aria one after the other.</p><h4>All Characters Mode</h4><p>Play through the game with all characters (except Coda) in succession. Unlocked after unlocking all characters except Coda.</p><h4>Deathless Mode</h4><p>All Zones Mode, but loops around at the end. This mode only ends when the player is defeated.</p><h4>Dance Pad Mode</h4><p>Designed for players to practice using dance pads with. Easier than the usual, as everything is unlocked, less enemies are spawned, and the player starts with better equipment.</p><h4>Level Editor</h4><p>Create levels and share them with others. Unlocked after beating Zone 4.</p><p><strong>Codex</strong></p><p>Puzzle rooms created with the intent of teaching players some advanced strategies. The Bard character is always selected in the Codex rooms.</p><ol><li>Dragon Lore: teaches players how to avoid a Red Dragon's fireballs and defeat it with the Red Dragon Dance</li><li>Trap Lore: teaches players strategies for navigating traps.</li><li>Bomb Lore: teaches players strategies for using bombs.</li><li>How To Get Away With Murder: teaches players strategies for defeating shopkeepers.</li></ol><h2>Music</h2><p>The original soundtrack is composed and produced by <a href=\"/danny-baranowsky/3040-99995/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99995\">Danny Baranowsky</a>. It features mostly electronic dance music with constant BPM (beats per minute) and set durations to allow for consistent play. There is one track for every level/boss, with alternate layers for Zone 3 and some boss phases, and a few additional tracks for training and menus.</p><p>An EDM remix soundtrack by A_Rival and a metal remix soundtrack by FamilyJules7x replaces the original soundtrack when playing as Melody and Aria, respectively. Two additional soundtracks were also added into the Playstation re-releases (also to PC platforms in a later patch), one by <a href=\"/jake-kaufman/3040-51915/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-51915\">Jake \"virt\" Kaufman </a>(chiptune, new default for Eli) and one by Girlfriend Records (synthwave). Any of the five soundtrack mixes can also be selected for any character in the options menu.</p><p>A custom music soundtrack can also be set to any levels (including bosses) at any time.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>There are multiple playable characters. Each character changes the way the player interacts with the game, the items they may discover, and the starting gear for All Zones mode.</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Character</th><th scope=\"col\">General Information</th><th scope=\"col\">Items</th><th scope=\"col\">All Zones mode</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cadence</td><td>The main hero.

Each zone contains three levels and a boss fight. Every level is <a href=\"/procedural-generation/3015-328/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-328\">procedurally generated</a>. Every proceeding level in a given zone has a faster tempo than the last, but the first level's tempo is not faster than the previous zone's last level. The boss fight for every zone (except the last) is randomly picked.</p><p>When the song for a level ends without the player reaching the stairs to the next level, a trap door will appear and send them immediately to the next level. This trap door behaves similarly to the stairs, specifically in that it does not lock the player in a room filled with monsters like normal trap doors do. The stairs for each level are locked until the player defeats the mini-boss for the level.</p><table data-max-width=\"false\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Zone No.</th><th scope=\"col\">Theme</th><th scope=\"col\">Description</th><th scope=\"col\">Monsters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Cave</td><td>The beginner zone. Consists of small rooms connected by narrow passageway. Has water tiles, which takes one extra step to cover up with dirt before getting out.</td><td>Slimes, bats, ghosts, skeletons</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Jungle</td><td>Has bigger passageways and less doors than the first zone. Has tar tiles, which always takes two steps to get out of.</td><td>Armadillos, golems, mushrooms, armored skeleton and skeleton mages</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fire &amp; Ice</td><td>Every level is separated into a fire section and an ice section. Consists of big, open rooms and cauldrons that spill hot coals or ice. Hot coal tiles damages the player when they don't move for one beat, and ice tiles causes the player to slide (attempting to move while sliding counts as a miss.)</td><td>Elementals, hellhounds, goblins, Yetis, skeleton knights</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Dungeon</td><td>Consists of rectangular rooms separated by walls. Digging a wall tile will dig wall tiles adjacent to it. Has green ooze tiles, which turns the player small and cannot attack enemies when they are on it.</td><td>Blademasters, liches, warlocks, harpies, spiders</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Minibosses</h2><p><a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">Minibosses</a> are spawned at the end of every level. They have to be defeated before the player can access the stairs to the next level. Most minibosses have different types of varying difficulty, which appear in different levels of the zone.</p><h4>Dragons</h4><p>The most iconic of fantasy creatures. Dragons move every other beat, pursuing and digging their way to the player. There are three types of dragons: green, red, and blue. Green Dragons only have melee attacks. Red Dragons charge a fireball when the player is directly on a horizontal line, and fire it on the next beat. Blue Dragons have a conic ice breath instead of a fireball, which freezes the players for 4 beats.</p><p>Red Dragons may prove tricky to defeat for beginners, as they spawn from 1-2 onwards. There is a well-known strategy to defeat Red Dragons, colloquially known as the Red Dragon Dance. To do the Red Dragon Dance, get in a position where the player is directly in front of a Red Dragon before it charges a fireball. The player can then attack the dragon, step to a side to dodge its fireball, step right next to the dragon (above or under), and step back. The player will be in the start position of the dance, but one tile over. Repeat until the dragon is defeated. When done perfectly, the dragon can be defeated within a 2x2 square.</p><h4>Minotaurs</h4><p>Minotaurs move on every beat, trying to pursue the player. When spotting a player in a cardinal direction, they will start charging in a straight line in that direction. When it hits a wall or an obstacle (e.g. the player), it will be stunned for two beats. Gray minotaurs have more health than the normal ones.</p><h4>Direbats</h4><p>Direbats move on every other beat in a random cardinal direction. Grey direbats have more health than the yellow ones.</p><h4>Banshees</h4><p>Banshees move on every beat towards the player, and can move diagonally. They will deafen the player of the soundtrack and get knocked back when hit. The deaf effect is nullified when they are defeated. The player has to be careful not to move right towards the Banshee after hitting, because they can still attack the player. Green banshees have more health than the blue ones. Starts appearing from Zone 2.</p><h4>Nightmares</h4><p>Nightmares move on every other beat towards the player, darkening the area surrounding it. Red nightmares have more health than black Nightmares. Starts appearing from Zone 2.</p><h4>Ogres</h4><p>Moves every four beats towards the player. It carries a large club that can reach three tiles. When the player is in range, it will raise its club to attack as its next move. The powerful club attack also damages other monsters and containers. Appears in Zone 4.</p><h4>The Mommy</h4><p>A dancing mummy mommy. Moves every four beats towards the player. Sometimes summons a breakdancing baby mummy instead of moving. The baby mummy moves towards the player every other beat. Appears in Zone 4.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><p>There is a <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss encounter</a> at the end of every zone. The boss you fight at each zone is randomly picked. Each boss functions in a different way, each having its own game mechanic associated to it. Each boss also has a legion of other enemies alongside that may stand in the player's way. Once the boss is defeated, all other enemies disappear. When the player defeats a boss without missing, there is a flawless victory bonus where the player can choose to open one of three chests.</p><p>Each boss functions slightly differently and may have different minions in different zones. The deeper the zone is, the more health they will also have.</p><h4>King Conga</h4><p>The king of the undead conga line, he sits atop his throne in amusement. King Conga cannot normally be hit on his throne and will only fight the player once his conga lines of zombies is defeated. King Conga moves on every beat and can also move diagonally. He also has the ability to teleport away to a random space upon taking damage.</p><p>King Conga will also get off the throne to attack the player when the player misses a beat even when the conga lines have not been defeated, but he will teleport back to his throne without getting damaged when the player attacks him. Every eighth beat in the song is skipped in this level, so the player must not move every seven beats or it will count as a miss.</p><p>There are two conga lines of zombies that follows the yellow leader zombie. If a zombie is separated from the conga line, they will turn red in rage. The red zombies move on every beat, while the other zombies move on every other beat.</p><h4>Death Metal</h4><p>A reaper of death that holds a scythe, a shield, and dances to a fast-paced metal song. Death Metal will chase after the player every three beats. He holds his shield in front of him, and it blocks non-phasing damage. Every time Death Metal blocks, bats will be summoned. Attacking him from other sides will eventually make him drop his shield.</p><p>After dropping his shield, he will occasionally shout a phrase that telegraphs his move. The move depends on how much health he has left. At high health (\"Come to me!\"), he will summon more minions after 4 beats. At lower health (\"End of the line!\"), he will summon stronger minions instead. At critical health (\"Bathe in fire!\"), he will instead shoot fireballs. He will also move on every beat at this last phase.</p><h4>Deep Blues</h4><p>A king with an entire army of chess pieces. Every piece behaves similarly to their corresponding chess piece at a consistent beat pattern, telegraphing one beat before moving. Like in chess, the pawns will also turn into queens when reaching the other end of the stage.</p><p>The king has more health than the other pieces and will run away from the player, castling with a rook at first chance. When attacked, the king will teleport away. The king will only move to attack the player once all other chess pieces are defeated.</p><h4>Coral Riff</h4><p>An electric guitar-shaped octopus who wields numerous musical instruments with every one of its tentacles. Half of the stage is filled with water, and every tile any of its body parts moves into will also turn into water tiles. Its tentacles will first attack the player two or four at a time. They will first submerge, and then reemerge around the player. They will teleport back when hit, or when the player does not attack them. The corresponding instrument will stop playing the background music when they are submerged or defeated.</p><p>When all eight tentacles have attacked twice or defeated, the remaining tentacles and the main body will all move slowly towards the player. Defeated tentacles will appear on the surrounding walls to continue playing the background music. The main body moves every two beats, splashing water to all surrounding tiles, turning them into water tiles and possibly damaging the player.</p><h4>Dead Ringer</h4><p>Only Cadence will encounter this boss at the end of Zone 4. Dead Ringer is completely invincible to non-phasing damage. Four bells are initially placed on the stage, and Dead Ringer will try to hit them with his big hammer. The bells will summon a miniboss when hit by either Dead Ringer or the player. From the top-left corner clockwise, they respectively spawn a green dragon, an ogre, a Nightmare, and a Minotaur. Dead Ringer may spot the player in a cardinal direction and charge at the player like a Minotaur. If Dead Ringer crashes into a bell, the bell gets destroyed without summoning a miniboss.</p><p>When all four bells have been rung or destroyed, Dead Ringer will begin to glow. He moves faster and charges straight to the other end of the line in one beat in this state. To defeat him, he must charge straight onto the large gong that appears at the top end of the room. Once he rings the gong with his charge, the fight instantly ends.</p><h4>The Necrodancer</h4><p>After defeating Dead Ringer, Cadence meets Dorian and they both get transported into the Necrodancer's lair. The player controls both Cadence and Dorian in this level, with both characters moving to the same key presses at the same time. The Necrodancer and his minions are up on a stage, holding the Golden Lute hostage with evil magic. They are unreachable while atop the stage.</p><p>Trap tiles are spawned on the level two at a time, and the player must control both Cadence and Dorian to stand on both tiles at the same time. The walls and stage can be used to offset their positions and match the placements of the tiles. For every traps that get activated, the Necrodancer's stage gets bombed, progressively releasing his minions until the Golden Lute and the Necrodancer himself are blown off the stage. Cadence must then defeat the Necrodancer using the Golden Lute (with Dorian still controlled at the same time). The Golden Lute damages the Necrodancer and his minions surrounding Cadence as she moves around.</p><p>After defeating the Necrodancer as Cadence, the player has to fight him for the last time as Melody. The walls keep shrinking as the song gets closer to the end, crushing Melody at the very end. The song also slowly increases its tempo as it progresses.</p><p>The Necrodancer will initially try to avoid Melody, depending on his numerous minions and the ever-shrinking wall. At his last heart, he will gain an impenetrable shield and summon many skeletons behind him. The top part of the level will also be transformed into lava. Melody must defeat the skeletons and push the Necrodancer into the lava to win the fight.</p><h2>Shops</h2><p>All shops sell items 3 at a time and accept a variety of currencies including gold, diamonds, and health. Gold is used as the score for the runs and is reset every run. Gold is dropped by monsters, and in some dungeon walls in All Zones Mode (visible by a shining glint). Diamonds are only found in non-All Zones modes on the dungeon floors and walls (replacing hidden gold). They must be spent in the lobby immediately after the run they are found for upgrades and item/spell unlocks.</p><h3>Dungeon Shops</h3><p>Many dungeon shops have golden walls, which can be destroyed by bomb or blood shovel to yield 10 gold coins per tile.</p><p>Most shopkeepers can also be murdered for an item drop and getting all the shop items for free. Keep in mind, however, that most shopkeepers are also very difficult to defeat. The final codex level (\"How To Get Away With Murder\") illustrates some strategies that could be used to defeat shopkeepers.</p><p>All shops other than the coin shop are only accessible through runes. They are hidden under wall tiles and must dug out to be used. Wall tiles that hide them have visible cracks.</p><p><strong>Coin Shop</strong> - The standard shop that sells items for gold. There is one on every floor and the walls are made of gold. Defeating a shopkeeper will leave all shops for the rest of the run abandoned, with items free for the taking.</p><p><strong>Grey Coin Shop </strong>- Looks like the standard shop, but the walls are slightly grey and the shopkeeper has red eyes. The shopkeeper is immediately hostile upon entering. Defeating this shopkeeper will not affect the normal coin shop.</p><p><strong>Glass Shop</strong> - A shop that sells glass weapons and armor for gold.</p><p><strong>Blood Shop</strong> - Any item can be sold here, but for the price of some of the hero's health.</p><p><strong>Health Shop </strong>- Sells food items and heart containers.</p><p><strong>Transmogrification</strong> - A chamber that accepts gold to replace current equipment with a random new piece.</p><p><strong>Shrine Shop </strong>- Allows the player to choose one of three shrines to use. Dragons will appear when the player attempts to blow the shrines up.</p><p><strong>Pawnbroker </strong>- Buys items from the player for half price. The shopkeeper transforms the whole shop into tar tiles when turning hostile.</p><p><strong>Conjurer</strong> - The conjurer will summon a random item of a chosen category for gold.</p><p><strong>Bait Shop</strong> - The shop area contains three items seemingly free for the taking. Upon picking one up, a few monsters (including minibosses) will spawn and the exit will be locked until they are defeated.</p><p><strong>Secret Dungeon Master Shop</strong> - May sometimes appear beyond the top wall of some shops. The shop floor is visible when the player has a far enough vision range. The player has to destroy the top wall to enter this shop. This shop will sell one powerful item for a low price. The dungeon master is the shopkeeper, and the only one that cannot be attacked.</p><h3>Lobby Shops</h3><p>These are shops found in the \"main menu\" lobby. Some of them have to be rescued from their cages within the dungeon. The cages are unlocked with Golden or Glass Keys, which can be found in the level's coin shop or hidden within the walls.</p><p><strong>Dungeon Master</strong> - Sells permanent upgrades like heart containers, coin multipliers, and the amount of chests that appear in dungeons. Like all lobby shops he accepts diamonds as currency.</p><p><strong>Hephaestus</strong> - Sells accessibility to open weapons, armor, and food in chests. After buying an item it will always appear in the next dungeon.</p><p><strong>Merlin</strong> - Sells accessibility to spells, rings, and scrolls. After buying an item it will always appear in the next dungeon.</p><p><strong>Beastmaster</strong> - Allows access to practice against all enemies the player has fought in dungeons before.</p><p><strong>Bossmaster</strong> - Allows access to practice against the games boss fights in all of the incarnations.</p><p><strong>Weaponmaster </strong>- Allows a selection of weapons (excluding Jeweled Dagger, Flower, and Golden Lute) for training in the Beastmaster and Bossmaster rooms.</p><p><strong>Janitor</strong> - Removes items from the item pool for the next non-All Zones run in exchange for diamonds.</p><p><strong>Diamond Dealer </strong>- Sells items to carry into the next non-All Zones run.</p><p> </p>",

After acquiring one of the enemy's advanced combat suits, Dallas easily dispatches the hostile troops and their support helicopter.

Claire scouts ahead, prompting Jason to follow after her when she does not respond to his calls.

In turn, attributes like accuracy, precision or stamina, are increased automatically. A unique attribute of Shadow Complex's XP system is the idea of XP multipliers. If the player performs certain actions (head shots, melee attacks) a multiplier is added for every successful move, increasing the overall XP reward. Shadow Complex also rewards the player for defeating larger enemies like bosses by exploiting their weaknesses or attacking them in clever ways. While all enemies can be defeated simply by continuous shooting for extended periods of time, the game \"knows\" when this is taking place and gives less XP.</p><p>Additionally, uncovering squares of the map grants more experience than killing enemies. However, acquiring collectibles grants the most experience of all.

Harry/Gen can also find power-ups to give himself more health or temporarily strengthen his hammer. </p><p>The game was originally released in the arcade before being ported to the NES and Famicom later the same year. This port was only available in Japan and Europe. The port was forced to remove certain mechanics like bashing boxes into foes as well as one of the game's six stages in order for the game to work on the limited tech of the console, and some of the boss fights were edited too. However, the NES version does retain the original arcade game's memorable voice samples. The NES version also allows Harry/Gen to take up to three hits, rather than the single hit K.O. the arcade version enforces.</p>",

Certain enemies also have a gimmick requiring the use of the Mega Buster to defeat them.</p><p>Mega Man also keeps all of his previous abilities from Mega Man 3, including the slide and his canine compatriot <a href=\"/rush/3005-1318/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1318\">Rush</a>. Additionally, Mega Man can also find two special items called the Wire and <a href=\"/balloon/3055-720/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-720\">Balloon </a>hidden in certain stages. The Wire acts like a grappling hook that can launch Mega Man vertically, and the Balloon creates floating platforms nearly identical to Item-1 from Mega Man 2. The inclusion of <a href=\"/eddie/3005-12032/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12032\">Eddie </a>is a minor addition as the items he dispenses are chosen at random.</p><h2>Stages</h2><h3>Robot Master Stages</h3><p>Dr. Cossack's mechanical minions consist of a standard group of eight Robot Masters.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse is a brawler based on the animated series in the early 1990s which is set in the X-Men world. It follows an original plot concerning the island nation of Genosha, which has started taking mutants hostage and is gearing up for a possible invasion of Sentinels. Five X-Men are sent in to sabotage the various facilities on Genosha and foil the villains behind the plot. The game eventually moves to Magneto's space station base, Avalon. Each of the X-Men's missions are unique to them, and occasionally make use of their specific powers.</p><p>The game was exclusive to the Super Nintendo and was released in the US, Europe and Japan. It was coincidentally released the same month as the similar <a href=\"/wolverine-adamantium-rage/3030-12002/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12002\">Wolverine: Adamantium Rage</a>, which was produced by LJN.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story first explains about what the mutants are and how they were helped. It is then revealed that there are mutants who were captured on the island of Genosha, who are then forced into labor by an army of robots called the Sentinels. It is believed that the powerful immortal mutant Apocalypse is responsible for these acts of terror. And so the five X-Men members were sent out to Genosha Island to infiltrate the island, rescue the mutants and gather information on Apocalypse's plans. All members of the X-Men split up to take out the enemies. Every mutant has direct objectives:</p><ul><li>Wolverine will access the Sentinel factory to destroy the robots.</li><li>Cyclops will intercept the train transport from the Genoshan army to destroy their access to supplies.</li><li>Psylocke goes full offensive on the main base to distract the army's attention.</li><li>Gambit sneaks into the harbor to eliminate the enemies.</li><li>Beast will make his way to the central computer to gain all information of where the captured mutants have been placed.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is based on a 2D beat-em-up platformer where the player walks from the left hand side to the right, defeating enemies as they pass. Each character has their own lives counter and extra lives can be gained either by collecting icons which has an \"X\" on it, or later on in the game, collecting an icon with the chosen hero on it as the icon will rotate through all the characters.</p><p>In the first act, there are five levels all based on each X-Men character where the level is also designed for each character's skills and even have their unique bosses.</p><p>At some stage in the game, the levels will also be the same where all characters can play the same stage.</p><p>The interface consists of the player's health bar and the name of the X-Men character shown underneath with the \"X\" logo on the left of the bar. When fighting boss characters, their health is shown on the right similar to the player's bar but an \"E\" is shown on the right of the bar.</p><h3>Controls</h3><p>The characters can be moved left and right, crouch to duck, and only two buttons are used: attack and jump.</p><p>The combat works just like <a href=\"/final-fight/3030-6722/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6722\">Final Fight</a> where tapping the attack button near an enemy will create a chain combo. The combos can also be cancelled into special moves as well, adding extra damage to the enemy.</p><p>After each level is complete, a password system (in the form of the X-Men characters) is shown on the screen so that players can re-enter this to get back where they left off in the game.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/beast/3005-5709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5709\">Beast</a></li><li><a href=\"/psylocke/3005-4396/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4396\">Psylocke</a></li><li><a href=\"/gambit/3005-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2379\">Gambit</a></li><li><a href=\"/wolverine/3005-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10\">Wolverine</a></li><li><a href=\"/cyclops/3005-2850/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2850\">Cyclops</a></li></ul>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast was developed by Raven Software and released for the PC in March of 2002. It was ported later that year to the Xbox, GameCube, and Mac. It is technically the fourth game in the series being proceeded by <a href=\"/star-wars-dark-forces/3030-11023/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11023\">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a>, <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight-dark-forces-ii/3030-7418/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7418\">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</a>, and <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight-mysteries-of-the-sith/3030-16288/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16288\">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith</a>. All versions were generally well received and a sequel entitled: <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight-jedi-academy/3030-16922/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16922\">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a> was released the following year. The PC version of Jedi Outcast was re-released in 2006 as part of a compilation entitled: Star Wars: The Best of PC.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Opening Crawl</h3><blockquote><p>It is a time of relative peace in the</p><p>galaxy. Eight years have passed</p><p>since the Empire's defeat</p><p>at the BATTLE OF ENDOR, but the</p><p>NEW REPUBLIC still struggles to</p><p>restore order and vanquish its enemies.</p><p>After defending the VALLEY OF THE</p><p>JEDI from the evil JEREC and</p><p>nearly falling to the Dark Side</p><p>himself, former Jedi Knight KYLE</p><p>KATARN has severed his connection with the Force</p><p>and returned to his mercenary ways.</p><p>With his longtime partner, JAN ORS,</p><p>Kyle continues to aid the Republic in the</p><p>fight against the IMPERIAL REMNANT.</p><p>As the Remnant launches its latest gambit to</p><p>regain control of the galaxy, Kyle and Jan have</p><p>been sent by the New Republic to investigate the</p><p>planet KEJIM, a long-dead Imperial outpost…</p></blockquote><h3>Plot</h3><p>The game takes place twelve years after the Battle of Yavin (12 ABY), a few years after the end of <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight-mysteries-of-the-sith/3030-16288/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16288\">Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith</a>. Like its predecessors, it is based around the character <a href=\"/kyle-katarn/3005-721/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-721\">Kyle Katarn</a>. Since nearly being taken in by the dark side, Kyle has given up his <a href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsaber</a> and the Force. He once again works with his partner (and now love interest) <a href=\"/jan-ors/3005-734/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-734\">Jan Ors</a> doing missions for the New Republic .</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/227486-28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-227486\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/227486-28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-227486\"><img alt=\"Kyle swinging his Lightsaber\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/227486-28.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/227486-28.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/227486-28.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/227486-28.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Kyle swinging his Lightsaber</figcaption></figure><p>Mon Mothma contacts them to investigate an Imperial Remnant base on Kejim. A part of a transmission sent from the base was decrypted and some keywords such as \"Reborn\" or \"Valley of the Jedi\" were revealed. In the base, they discover murdered prisoners, and a link to another planet on the outer rim where the Imperials are doing experiments on infusing the Force into living subjects.</p><p>Jan and Kyle infiltrate the facility and free the prisoners, but Jan is captured by two Dark Jedi. Katarn is initially eager to rescue his love interest, but <a href=\"/desann/3005-743/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-743\"> Desann</a> ignites his lightsaber and Katarn has no choice but to fight him. Desann easily defeats the mercenary but spares him, saying he would be a worthier adversary if he had the power of the Force. Desann then ordered <a href=\"/tavion-axmis/3005-760/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-760\"> Tavion</a> to kill Jan, which she seemingly does. Kyle embarks to the <a href=\"/valley-of-the-jedi/3035-1020/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1020\"> Valley of the Jedi</a> to regain his Force powers and then to Yavin 4 to retrieve his lightsaber from <a href=\"/luke-skywalker/3005-1062/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1062\"> Luke Skywalker</a>, intent on revenge, to which Luke warns him of the dangerous path he is following. What Kyle doesn't know is that he was set up and that Desann had followed him to the Valley, using its power to infuse the Force into his soldiers, creating the Reborn and with Galak Fyyai's help the Shadowtroopers. He plans to use this army to invade the Jedi Temple on Yavin IV and restore the <a href=\"/galactic-empire/3015-1007/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1007\"> Empire</a>. When Kyle spares his apprentice, Tavion, she admits the plan, and tells him Jan is still alive. He radios Rogue Squadron and stows away on Desann's personal ship, where he finds Jan unhurt and alive.</p><p>After knocking out the shields of Desann's flagship,<i> </i><i> </i><i> </i> Doomgiver and killing Galak, he takes an escape pod to Yavin 4 and helps fend off Desann's attack, fighting his way through Reborn and Shadowtroopers, eventually killing the Dark Jedi. At the end of the game, he accepts Luke's offer of a teaching position at the Academy, but not before he spends some time off with Jan Ors.</p><h2>Combat</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5362/263974-penisshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263974\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.50834879406308\" data-width=\"539\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 539px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5362/263974-penisshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263974\"><img alt=\"Slice 'n Dice 'em\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5362/263974-penisshot.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5362/263974-penisshot.jpg 539w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5362/263974-penisshot.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px\" data-width=\"539\"></a><figcaption>Slice 'n Dice 'em</figcaption></figure><p>There are two distinct gameplay styles in Jedi Outcast. It is a first-person shooter reminiscent of such games as <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> or <a href=\"/quake-iii-arena/3030-3874/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3874\">Quake III</a>, but also features in-depth lightsaber duelling mechanics. As Kyle, the player can perform a wide range of attacks based on both player inputs and an enemy's location in relation to the player. There is only one primary attack button, but the player still has several different moves at their disposal depending on if he/she moves one way or the other, which direction the mouse or thumb-stick is moved, hitting the attack button a second time, and so on. The player also has three different fighting styles to choose from; speed (represented by a blue line), strength (represented by a pink/reddish line) and medium (represented by a yellow line, also this is the default fighting style) all of which are self-explanatory.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><ul><li>Arakyd 3t3 missile</li><li>Bacta</li><li>Blast door</li><li>Bryar pistol</li><li>Bowcaster</li><li>Blaster rifle</li><li>Comlink</li><li>DEMP 2</li><li>Detpack</li><li>Disruptor</li><li>Flechette</li><li>Hologram</li><li>Holopad</li><li>Light Amplification Goggles</li><li>Lightsaber</li><li>Medpack</li><li>Merr-Sonn</li><li>Neuro-Saav Model TD2.3 electrobinoculars</li><li>Personal shield (Armor)</li><li>Planetary ion cannon</li><li>Repeater</li><li>Scomp link</li><li>Seeker Drone</li><li>Sensor Array</li><li>Shield generator</li><li>Stun baton</li><li>Thermal detonator</li><li>Trip mine</li></ul><p> </p><h3>Force Powers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-178658\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-178658\"><img alt=\"Kyle Katarn uses force lightning on stormtroopers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kyle Katarn uses force lightning on stormtroopers.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/178658-screen056.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kyle Katarn uses force lightning on stormtroopers.</figcaption></figure><p>The player is also given a considerable amount of Force powers to use, necessary for certain puzzles, and very helpful in combat. These include such powers as Force push, Force pull, Force lightning, Jedi Mind Trick, and Lightsaber Throw. However, unlike Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, the player cannot choose which Force power they receive, instead at the beginning of each mission (after receiving the lightsaber and basic force powers) they get a new force power or an upgrade to a power they already have.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The multiplayer component is a very key part in this game and is still played by many people today. Many modes are available such as free-for-all (deathmatch/slayer), team free-for-all, and Capture the Flag. There are also many customization options available to let the host do things like disable Force powers, make the the match lightsabers only, and other things which can make multiplayer more interesting or more of a challenge. Also, bots can be used in all modes in multiplayer.</p><h2>PC Requirements</h2><p> </p><ul><li>Windows 95 OSR2/98/ME/2000/XP;</li><li>Pentium II or AMD class 350 MHz or faster CPU;</li><li>64 MB RAM required, 128 MB required for Windows 2000 and XP;</li><li>16 MB OpenGL compliant 3D accelerator card;</li><li>16-bit DirectX 8.x compatible sound card;</li><li>4x CD-ROM drive;</li><li>665 MB hard drive space (Min.)</li></ul>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>In 2012, Square Enix announced <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/kingdom-hearts-hd-1-5-remix/3030-39815/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39815\">Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</a> for Playstation 3. It contained only the first three games in the series and was released in 2013. Yet, immediately after 1.5 was announced, it was hinted that a second collection containing more games was soon to follow. After a year of hints and denials, <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts-hd-ii-5-remix/3030-44229/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44229\">Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix</a> was officially announced at a Kingdom Hearts event at Disney's D23 Expo in Japan. It was released in 2014 and contained <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/kingdom-hearts-ii/3030-4763/#toc-0-9\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4763\">Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep/3030-21447/#toc-0-7\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21447\">Birth by Sleep Final Mix</a> &amp; cutscenes from <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/kingdom-hearts-recoded/3030-31644/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31644\">Re: Coded</a>. This marks the first time Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Birth by Sleep Final Mix will be available outside of Japan.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>During an interview with co-director <a href=\"/tai-yasue/3040-94191/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-94191\">Tai Yasue</a> at E3 2014, he mentioned that the development team is made up of 70 people many of whom are also working on <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts-iii/3030-42926/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42926\">Kingdom Hearts III</a>. He also that in order to focus on Kingdom Hearts III, the developers decided to drop the multiplayer aspect of the <a href=\"/mirage-arena/3035-4709/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4709\">Mirage Arena </a>in Birth by Sleep. They re-worked the Mirage Arena's bosses so that they would be easier playing solo, and that the Mirage Arena would have new rules and bonus.</p>",

Although it maintains its predecessors' theme of exploration, combat, and the acquisition of new abilities as the game progresses, the story unfolds in a more controlled, immersive fashion due to the addition of an A.I. commander, nicknamed \"Adam\", who explicitly tells protagonist <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran</a> the best places for her to head next.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The release of Fusion was timed to coincide with that of Metroid Prime for the <a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Nintendo GameCube</a>. The two games are not directly linked in either storyline or gameplay, but players who completed one game could use a link cable between the two systems to unlock bonus features in the other.</p><ul><li>Connecting the games together after the completion of Metroid Prime will unlock a 3D version of Samus' Fusion Suit from Fusion for use in Prime.

This RAM is blanked out once the unit is shut down, though, and the game must be re-loaded into memory each time, so players must make use of the system's sleep feature if they wish to keep it loaded for more than one play session.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 240px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968387-metroid_fusion_x_boss_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968387\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968387-metroid_fusion_x_boss_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968387\"><img alt=\"Samus Aran fights off the X Parasites in Metroid Fusion.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968387-metroid_fusion_x_boss_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/968387-metroid_fusion_x_boss_.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></a><figcaption>Samus Aran fights off the X Parasites in Metroid Fusion.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fusion is a 2D side-scrolling game in the tradition of the original Metroid, Metroid II: Return of Samus, and Super Metroid. Players control Samus Aran in a hostile environment full of deadly enemies, hidden power-ups, and boss characters who confer permanent new abilities upon their defeat. These additional skills can then be used to access areas which could not be reached before, steadily expanding Samus' arsenal until the climactic final battle. Defeating regular enemies often reveals items which can help refill Samus' energy bar or replenish her stock of missiles and super bombs.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Many of the power-ups in the game have been carried forward from previous games in the series, including weaponry like the bombs and the charge beam, and mobility skills like the Space Jump and the Gravity Suit. Others have been subtly tweaked, such as the ice missiles which replace the traditional <a href=\"/ice-beam/3055-906/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-906\">ice beam</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game can only be saved by accessing specific stations marked on the map. Since this is a portable game, however, the option to place the GBA into a power-saving standby mode can allow players on the move to temporarily preserve their progress and battery life.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like the previous Metroid games, Fusion's plot features only one ending, but players are rewarded with different endgame artwork depending on what percentage of optional power-ups were found and how quickly the game was beaten. The most advanced ending requires 100% collection of all items and a completion time under two hours.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Chronologically set shortly after the events of Super Metroid, Fusion begins with a cinematic intro depicting Samus' return to the planet <a href=\"/sr388/3035-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-374\">SR-388</a> with a squad of marines and a research team. Samus is attacked by a previously-unknown organism known as an <a href=\"/x-parasite/3015-2869/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2869\">X Parasite</a> which aggressively infiltrates her <a href=\"/power-suit/3055-1031/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1031\">Power Suit</a>'s biological components as well as her own central nervous system. Because she was unconscious, the only way for doctors to operate on her was to cut off the outer layer of the suit, robbing Samus of nearly all of her abilities. Her life is only saved through a stroke of luck when the scientists formulate a vaccine from preserved cells from <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">the Last Metroid.</a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Samus is saved, but her physiology is permanently altered by the Metroid DNA now spliced into her own. Since Metroids were the X Parasite's natural predator (it is revealed, in fact, that Metroids were genetically engineered by the Chozo for the specific purpose of preventing the X Parasites from spreading out and infecting the entire universe), she can never again be infected by the parasite, and in fact regains health as she absorbs them into her body. However, she's also inherited the natural weakness to frigid temperatures that she has exploited in the past to defeat countless Metroids.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Her newfound immunity to X infection makes Samus the only choice to investigate a mysterious explosion at the B.S.L. deep-space research station, where she was stationed, and which went radio-silent shortly after the pieces of her Power Suit were sent there for study. Upon landing, Samus swiftly discovers that X Parasites have somehow broken free of their containment and are spreading throughout the facility, consuming and mimicking every lifeform they encounter. Most dangerous of all is the <a href=\"/sa-x/3005-3016/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3016\">SA-X</a>: a vicious simulacrum of Samus herself, borne from the pieces of her infected Power Suit and dedicated to hunting the real Samus down and murdering her.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This is a list of all the upgrades that players can acquire in Metroid Fusion:</p><h3>Missile Launcher</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Missile Launcher grants Samus the ability to fire concussive projectiles. Players can find extra missile expansions throughout the station.</p><h3>Morph Ball</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">By pressing down on the D-Pad twice players will enter <a href=\"/morph-ball/3055-1049/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball</a> mode. Assuming the ball shape, Samus can lay bombs and crawl through small openings with this ability. There are a few more abilities to be found usable with Morph Ball mode.</p><h3>Charge Beam</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/charge-beam/3055-1027/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1027\">Charge Beam</a> allows players to charge up energy in Samus's Beam Weapon before releasing a powerful shot stronger than a normal blast. Some enemies in the game can only be injured by a charged shot, so experiment with this if normal weapons can't inflict damage. Hold down B to charge up the weapon and release to fire. Samus' beam projectiles will also become slightly larger. Players can also simulate the <a href=\"/screw-attack/3015-504/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-504\">Screw Attack</a> with this by charging up the weapon and somersaulting through the air.</p><h3>Morph Ball Bomb</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This Morph Ball ability allows players to lay small bombs to damage enemies or break open certain blocks. Pressing B while Morph Ball mode is active will cause Samus to lay a bomb, players can lay up to three at a time.</p><h3>Hi-Jump/Jump Ball</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/hi-jump-boots/3055-1448/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1448\">Hi-Jump</a> and Jumpball (Spring Ball) are acquired together. The Hi-Jump allows Samus to jump higher than normal; this way, reaching those difficult platforms higher above won't be so hard. The Jumpball also allows Samus to jump while in Morph Ball mode.</p><h3>Speed Booster</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This handy ability allows Samus to run at ultra-high speeds through long corridors. Any enemies caught in Samus' path will be incinerated.</p><h3>Super Missile</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This upgrade will enhance the damaging power of missiles to three times the concussive power of regular missiles. Once players find this upgrade, all missiles from that point forward will be upgraded to <a href=\"/super-missile/3055-1928/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1928\">Super Missiles</a>.</p><h3>Varia Suit</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The awesome Varia Suit allows Samus to survive in areas with extreme temperatures, such as those scorching locales in Sector 3 (PYR). Damage inflicted on Samus will lower as well, and players won't be frozen when they absorb large blue Xs found in various sectors.</p><h3>Ice Missile</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because Samus now has Metroid DNA in her genetic code, she cannot safely absorb the Ice Beam; as her body's systems are tied into the suit's beam functions, her body would eventually freeze solid from the inside out. Instead, the Galactic Federation has developed a type of missile that releases a burst of freezing energy instead of exploding. This enhancement adds this freezing effect to every missile that the player fires, though it does not negatively impact the destructive power of the missiles. Just like the Ice Beam, enemies struck by an Ice Missile will become frozen. Firing a second missile upon a frozen target will destroy it. While frozen, enemies can be used as stepping stones to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.</p><h3>Wide Beam</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This Beam Weapon addition increases Samus' range of fire. Players will be able to fire out three bursts of energy that cover the same height as Samus herself. This makes striking small enemies low on the ground easier; with its wide range, players won't have to be as accurate as before to strike an enemy.</p><h3>Power Bomb</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players will find the first <a href=\"/power-bomb/3055-2001/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2001\">Power Bomb</a> in a designated Data Room. These bombs create major explosions that wipe out anything on-screen. Lay them by activating Morph Ball mode, then while holding R press B to lay a bomb. These bombs will come in handy throughout the station, especially as there are loads of Power Bomb expansions to be found.</p><h3>Space Jump</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Just like in Super Metroid, this ability allows Samus to virtually \"fly\" through the air. While pressing A at the right time, Samus performs a somersault in the air and players will rise up higher. This can be used indefinitely to reach any height.</p><h3>Plasma Beam</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The strongest of all Beam Weapons, the <a href=\"/plasma-beam/3055-1024/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1024\">Plasma Beam</a> allows Samus to fire piercing green shots of energy. These blasts practically shred any enemies they strike, so most enemies will go down with only a single shot or two from this weapon. Coupled with the Wave Beam this produces a deadly effect.</p><h3>Gravity Suit</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/gravity-suit/3055-1033/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1033\">Gravity Suit</a> allows Samus to move around freely underwater, this is particularly useful for water sections in Sector 4. Players also be able to wade through some of the various lava lakes riddled throughout Sector 3 without taking damage. This also increases Samus' defense.</p><h3>Diffusion Missile</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The final missile addition, the Diffusion Missile, allows players to charge up Samus' Missile Launcher. By holding down R, players will charge up energy in the launcher. Upon pressing B, Samus will fire a missile. Once it strikes a target a massive ring of ice will expand out from the impact zone to spread out beyond the reach of the screen. Anything caught in the blast will become instantly frozen.</p><h3>Wave Beam</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/wave-beam/3055-1023/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1023\">Wave Beam</a> causes Samus's Beam Weapon projectiles to fly forward in a wavy pattern. Apart from this visual enhancement, players will be able to fire through solid walls, floors, and ceilings. It can be used to open one-way panel doors from the other side.</p><h3>Screw Attack</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This addition allows Samus to charge up energy in her suit while performing a somersault jump in mid-air. Any enemies caught by Samus while she's charging energy will explode, but remember to catch the X parasite when it tries to escape. Players will also be able to break through Screw Attack blocks while charging energy.</p><h3>Ice Beam</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Despite the ship's computer's doubts of Samus being able to survive the Ice Beam, Players will eventually be able to recover this ability - albeit for a short time only. This weapon fires sub-zero blasts of ice, freezing any targets it strikes.</p><h2>Additional Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Metroid Fusion includes two other abilities that hark back to its predecessor, Super Metroid.</p><h3>Wall Jump</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Samus can perform the Wall Jump from the onset of the game. This is done by jumping toward a wall, then quickly pressing the D-Pad in the direction opposite the wall followed by the A button upon contact. If timed correctly, this ability allows Samus to scale narrow shafts and reach heights that would otherwise only be accessible with the Hi-Jump or Space Jump.</p><h3>Shinespark</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once Samus acquires the Speed Booster ability, she is also able to perform the <a href=\"/shinespark/3015-2805/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2805\">Shinespark</a>, which sends Samus rocketing in any direction. While speed boosting, quickly tap down on the D-Pad to crouch. Samus will continue to flash for a couple of seconds. Quickly double-tap the A button followed by a direction on the D-Pad to engage the Shinespark. Although it is not integral to the completion of the game, the Shinespark is necessary for collecting certain items.</p>",

It was initially released on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Famicom</a> (Super Nintendo) in 1994, but has since then been re-released on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Nintendo Wii's</a> <a href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-87\">Virtual Console</a>. It is the third game in the <a href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid</a> franchise, and the plot picks up where the last game in the series, <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a>, left off.</p><p>Like most games of the series, Super Metroid is an 2D action-adventure game with platforming elements. Players take the role of a female bounty hunter known as <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran</a> as she explores the deadly planet <a href=\"/zebes/3035-373/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-373\">Zebes</a> and collect an arsenal of weapons and gadgets, which will in turn let her progress into areas that were previously inaccessible.</p><p>Super Metroid was one of the largest and most graphically-impressive games for the console at the time of its release. Even today, the game is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time.</p><p>Super Metroid is also famous for the unintentional ability to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">\"sequence break\"</a> the game. This means that although there is roughly a set path for Samus to follow, skilled players are capable of reaching ledges or getting past <a href=\"/barrier/3015-1522/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1522\">barriers</a> before they have discovered the power up that is ordinarily required to get there. For example, by mastering a maneuver known as the 'mockball' players can get the super missiles very early in the game, when they enter <a href=\"/brinstar/3035-1572/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1572\">Brinstar</a> for the first time. This curious mechanic has many people struggling to see who can find the fastest path to take to complete the game, making Super Metroid one of the first games surrounded by the <a href=\"/speedrun/3015-179/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-179\">'speedrun'</a> phenomenon.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215607\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215607\"><img alt=\"The famous line\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The famous line</figcaption></figure><p>Super Metroid opens with a short summary of its predecessor, <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> on the Nintendo <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>. After she eradicated the Metroids from their homeworld, <a href=\"/sr388/3035-374/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-374\">SR-388</a>, Samus Aran finds a Metroid hatchling, which believed her to be its mother. Unable to end its life, Samus brings the Metroid larvae to the <a href=\"/ceres-space-colony/3035-2087/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2087\">Ceres Space Colony</a>, so that scientists could study the mysterious power of the Metroids.</p><p>However, just as she leaves, Samus receives a distress signal coming from Ceres. She immediately returns, only to find everyone dead. After a short treck through the Colony Samus encounters her nemesis, <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a>. They have a short battle which ends with Ridley taking the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> into his possession. She then escapes the space colony as it <a href=\"/self-destruct/3015-1008/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1008\">self-destructs</a> and tracks Ridley to a nearby planet, Zebes.</p><p>Upon landing on the planet, Samus arrives in <a href=\"/crateria/3035-1571/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1571\">Crateria</a> and shortly after arriving finds the morph ball and missiles power ups. Afterwards she collects the morph ball bombs and, before she can exit the room, she is attacked by a <a href=\"/torizo/3015-4417/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4417\">Torizo</a> which she defeats. She takes these power ups with her into <a href=\"/brinstar/3035-1572/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1572\">Brinstar</a>. While in Brinstar she fights the sub-boss <a href=\"/spore-spawn/3005-3730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3730\">Spore Spawn</a> in order to receive super missiles. After visiting Upper Norfair to obtain the Hi-Jump Boots, Samus travels to <a href=\"/kraids-lair/3035-1577/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1577\">Kraid's Lair</a> in order to obtain the <a href=\"/varia-suit/3055-1032/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1032\">Varia Suit</a>. After defeating <a href=\"/kraid/3005-3010/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3010\">Kraid</a>, Samus receives the Varia Suit allowing her to travel deeper into <a href=\"/norfair/3035-1574/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1574\">Norfair</a>.</p><p>While exploring Norfair Samus finds serveral more power-ups including the Grapple Beam and she defeats the sub-boss <a href=\"/crocomire/3005-4008/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4008\">Crocomire</a>. After exploring Norfair, Samus uses the Grapple Beam to gain access to the <a href=\"/wrecked-ship/3035-1573/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1573\">Wrecked Ship</a>. When she arrives the power is off and the place is deserted except for ghosts. Eventually she arrives in a room and the boss <a href=\"/phantoon/3005-3996/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3996\">Phantoon</a> appears. After defeating Phantoon, power returns to the ship allowing Samus to fully explore it. While exploring the ship she finds the Gravity Suit which will allow her to freely travel through water.</p><p>Samus then returns to Brinstar and uses a power bomb to break the glass tube separating Brinstar from <a href=\"/maridia/3035-1575/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1575\">Maridia</a>. With the Gravity Suit equipped Samus is able to explore the flooded Maridia fully. While in Maridia she defeats the sub-boss <a href=\"/botwoon/3005-9297/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9297\">Botwoon</a> and the boss <a href=\"/draygon/3005-3999/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3999\">Draygon</a>. Upon defeating Draygon Samus receives the Space Jump ability which will allow her access into Lower Norfair where <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a> resides.</p><p>Shortly after entering lowering Norfair, Samus enters a battle with a Golden Torizo which is much more powerful than the previous Torizo she battled. After defeating it she receives her final power-up, the Screw Attack. After further traveling through Lower Norfair she eventually reaches Ridley's hideout. After defeating Ridley she enters the next room but finds that the Metroid Hatchling is not there.</p><p>After this she returns to Crateria and enters the room with the four golden statues of the bosses. The gems of the bosses break and the statues collapse granting Samus entrance into the Space Pirates base, <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a>. While traveling through Tourian, Samus reaches an area where the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> (now fully grown) comes out of nowhere and attacks an enemy. After killing the enemy it proceeds to attack Samus draining all of here energy tanks and leaving her with just one blip of energy.</p><p>After recovering at a nearby energy machine, Samus eventually confronts <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a> who resides in her signature glass tube. Once Samus does enough damage to Mother Brain the tube collapses and Mother Brain reveals her true form. Halfway through the battle Mother Brain begins to drain all of Samus' energy using a beam attack. Before Mother Brain can unleash the killing blow the Metroid Hatchling appears and attacks her. While Mother Brain is stunned from the attacked the Hatchling begins to regenerates Samus' energy. However, Mother Brain recovers from her stunned state and begins to attack the Hatchling while it is in the process of helping Samus. Mother Brain deals a final blow to the Hatchling killing it, but right before it dies it uses the last bit of its strength to give Samus the power of the Phazon Beam which Samus uses to easily finish off Mother Brain.</p><p>After Mother Brain is defeated a <a href=\"/self-destruct-sequence/3015-423/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-423\">self-destruct sequence</a> is activated and Samus has 3 minutes to get out of Tourian and escape planet <a href=\"/zebes/3035-373/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-373\">Zebes</a> before it explodes. While on her way to her ship she stops to save the animals that helped her earlier in the game. Once she reaches her ship she takes off and while she is flying away Zebes is seen exploding in the background.</p><h2>Power Ups</h2><p>Samus' suit can be augmented with a number of <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power ups</a> that grant her new powers and abilities. Each element can be configured on or off in the suit equipment menu. There are a great deal of power ups to collect scattered throughout Zebes and each one that is collected, along with map squares discovered, increases the completion percentage which is displayed at the end of the game.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Power Up</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994591\"><img alt=\"Energy Tank\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Energy Tank\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Energy Tank</figcaption></figure></td><td><a href=\"/energy-tank/3055-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1926\">Energy tanks</a> increase Samus' maximum energy by 100 points.

It is usually used during the Mother Brain fight as it is capable of killing her very quickly. Another interesting note is that the beam can only be fired to the left, if fired to the right the game will crash.</td></tr><tr><td>Space/Time Beam</td><td>The Space/Time Beam is another unofficial beam that can be obtained using a glitch. Instead of equipping all five beams at once, equipping the Spazer Beam, Plasma Beam, and Ice Beam together will produce the Space/Time Beam (Charge Beam can also be equipped though it is optional). The beam causes heavy lag and is registered as morph ball bomb damage when shot at enemies. The beam is best known for its ability to permanently corrupt the game, make strange alterations to the graphics, and produce several glitches such as resetting item pick-ups.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Abilities</b></h3><table><thead><tr><th>Ability</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-640107\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87222222222222\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-640107\"><img alt=\"Morph Ball\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 360w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Morph Ball\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 360w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Morph Ball</figcaption></figure></td><td>The <a href=\"/morph-ball/3055-1049/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball</a> gives Samus the ability to curl up into a ball in order to roll through small spaces.

Various techniques such as the mock ball have been used to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">sequence break</a> past large sections of the game and these techniques are vital in speedruns of the game. There are many opportunities to sequence break and many techniques that can be used to travel through the game at a much faster rate (i.e. shinesparking and spike jumping), because of this the game is speedran often and in many different ways. Speedruns can be run for 100% item completion, low% completion, any% completion, or for certain challenge runs such as beating the bosses in reverse order which requires very advanced techniques to complete.</p><p>Tool assisted speed runs are often much faster than there non-tool assisted equivalents. For example, currently the fastest non-tool assisted any% speedrun of the game is 44 minutes 54 seconds real time set on September 27, 2013 by Kottpower. The fastest any% tool assisted time is 38 minutes 41 seconds real time set on October 25, 2009 by Taco &amp; Kriole, nearly 8 minutes faster than the non-tool assisted run. The reason for the big time difference is because in a tool assisted run the runner plays the game one frame at a time and uses save states in order to create the perfect run. The runner also uses techniques that aren't humanly possible without playing the game at extremely slow speeds to save a lot of time. However, because the game is so popular in the speedrunning world, new ways to save time are being discovered which causes world record times to be broken.

Some are exploited in speedruns in order to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">sequence break</a> past areas of the game. However, only a small number of the glitches are actually used in speedruns and the majority of them are graphical glitches that are not useful to speedrunners. In addition, there are a small number of glitches that can freeze the game or permanently destroy the games SRAM ruining the cart. However, these type of glitches are very rare and almost impossible to perform on accident. Here are some of the more useful glitches used by speedrunners:</p><p>Mockball - The Mockball glitch allows Samus to retain her running speed while in morph ball form. This glitch can be used to get <a href=\"/super-missile/3055-1928/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1928\">super missiles</a> without having to face <a href=\"/spore-spawn/3005-3730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3730\">Spore Spawn</a> which saves a lot of time.</p><p>Quick-charge - The quick-charge glitch allows Samus to charge up her shinespark over a much shorter distance. The glitch is useful in several areas as shinesparking allows the player to quickly dash through rooms, but it most notably allows the player to enter the <a href=\"/wrecked-ship/3035-1573/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1573\">Wrecked Ship</a> without collecting the <a href=\"/grapple-beam/3055-1053/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1053\">Grapple Beam</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023298\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023298\"><img alt=\"Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 1440w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 1440w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event</figcaption></figure><p>Stand-up glitch - The stand-up glitch allows Samus to \"stand up\" in the <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a> fight during the scripted scene where the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> attacks Mother Brain, heals Samus while being attacked by Mother Brain, and then gives Samus the Hyper Beam after it is killed by Mother Brain. Usually Samus in incapacitated during this entire scene, but this glitch allows Samus to move around and attack Mother Brain during the scene allowing for a much quicker fight.</p><p>X-Ray Climb - The X-Ray Climb glitch allows Samus to get stuck in walls and travel outside of rooms without using doors. This glitch can be used to enter <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a> without defeating any bosses, and obtaining a 6% completion percentage which is the lowest possible completion percentage.</p><h2>ROM Hacks</h2><p>Super Metroid is also frequently hacked primarily by using a program called SMILE (Super Metroid Integrated Level Editor). This allows fans of the game to change the games layout however they want whether they want to make small changes or completely change the layout. It also allows them to make graphical changes to give the game a fresh new look. These hacks are not commercial products, they are created and shared among fans of the game for free. They are, however, a big part of why the game still has a large player base almost 17 years after its original release. These hacks give players new ways to experience the game by providing different layouts to explore and, in some hacks, new graphics.</p><p>Many ROM hacks have been created by fans with the help of SMILE and there is a popular forum dedicated to Metroid hacks called <a href=\"http://forum.metroidconstruction.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metroid Construction</a>. At Metroid Construction users can share their created hacks with other members, provide feedback on certain hacks, ask hacking questions, and many other things. Here are some examples of notable Super Metroid hacks:</p><h3> </h3><h3>Super Metroid: Redesign</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705513\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2383333333333\" data-width=\"2400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1705513\"><img alt=\"Map of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" data-width=\"516\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png 2400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/1705513-1.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1705513-1.png 775w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png 516w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Map of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1705513-1.png 2400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4527/1705513-1.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1705513-1.png 775w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1705513-1.png 516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" data-width=\"516\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Map of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size</figcaption></figure><p>Super Metroid: Redesign is a massive ROM Hack created by Drewseph which, as the name would suggest, completely redesigns the game.

In addition to this, changes have been made to the physics so that Samus falls to the ground quicker after jumping and new items have been added. A new goal has also been added, Samus has to disable 12 <a href=\"/chozo/3015-605/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-605\">Chozo</a> Guardians, which are hidden throughout the game, in order to enter <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a>.</p><p>For the development of Super Metroid: Redesign, Drewseph was the project leader and level designer.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing game developed by <a href=\"/squaresoft/3010-6323/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Squaresoft</a> (now known as <a href=\"../../square-enix/65-104/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Square Enix</a>) and originally released for <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> in 1997. Square also published the game in Japan, but its release in North America and Europe was handled by <a href=\"/sony-interactive-entertainment/3010-995/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-995\">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. The story follows <a href=\"/cloud-strife/3005-321/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-321\">Cloud Strife</a>, an aloof <a href=\"/mercenary/3015-2073/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2073\">mercenary</a> hired by an <a href=\"/eco-terrorism/3015-7805/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7805\">eco-terrorist</a> group known as <a href=\"/avalanche/3015-1506/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1506\">AVALANCHE</a>. This tiny resistance group struggles to protect their world (referred to simply as \"the Planet\" or \"<a href=\"/gaia/3035-214/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-214\">Gaia</a>\") from ruthless exploitation by the <a href=\"/corporation/3015-5746/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5746\">megacorporation</a> <a href=\"/shinra-electric-power-company/3015-53/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-53\">Shinra</a>, pitting the ex-<a href=\"/soldier/3015-1237/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1237\">SOLDIER</a> Cloud and his companions against Shinra's heavily-armed security forces.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII is generally credited for popularizing the role-playing genre outside of Japan, thanks in part to its extensive use of pre-rendered <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a>, and its overwhelming critical and commercial success helped to pave the way for the rise of cinematic storytelling in the video game industry. Because the game's pre-rendered video content requires a significant amount of storage space, the PlayStation release of Final Fantasy VII consists of <a href=\"/multiple-discs/3015-1209/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1209\">three discs</a> which are swapped-between at certain points over the course of the story.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII has also been acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation, helping to cement Sony's dominant position over other fifth-generation console manufacturers. This was especially true in the case of <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>, as Final Fantasy VII first began development in 1994 as a <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> <a href=\"/platform-exclusive/3015-5670/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5670\">platform exclusive</a>. However, due to the technical limitations and higher manufacturing costs associated with the N64's <a href=\"/game-cartridge/3055-6085/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6085\">cartridge</a>-based format, the game's development was eventually transitioned to Sony's PlayStation hardware, causing a rift between Square and Nintendo that put an end to their working relationship for several years afterward.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/199505-file.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-199505\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/199505-file.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-199505\"><img alt=\"Midgar, the game's first major location\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/199505-file.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/199505-file.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4086/199505-file.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/199505-file.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Midgar, the game's first major location</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VII's opening cinematic depicts the disc-shaped city of <a href=\"/midgar/3035-85/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-85\">Midgar</a>, an industrialized <a href=\"/dystopian-world/3015-591/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-591\">dystopia</a> built atop the convergence of several older villages (now known only as \"Sectors\") and powered by convenient <a href=\"/mako/3015-1241/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1241\">Mako</a> energy. The city is controlled by the <a href=\"/shinra-electric-power-company/3015-53/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-53\">Shinra Electric Power Company</a>, an oppressive <a href=\"/corporation/3015-5746/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5746\">megacorporation</a> headquartered in Midgar that leverages their global monopoly on basic utilities, as well as a powerful standing military, in order to exert their authority over much of the world's population. Shinra's <a href=\"/mako-reactor/3055-990/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-990\">Mako reactors</a> create power by extracting \"<a href=\"/lifestream/3015-1509/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1509\">Lifestream</a>,\" the physical form of the <a href=\"/gaia/3035-214/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-214\">Planet's</a> spiritual energy, directly out of the earth. Their unchecked harvesting and conversion of Lifestream into expendable Mako energy has led to widespread ecological decay, potentially threatening all life on the Planet.</p><p>The story follows detached ex-<a href=\"../../soldier/92-1237/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOLDIER</a> member <a href=\"../../cloud-strife/94-321/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloud Strife</a>, a mercenary seeking employment in Midgar. He is hired by the tiny resistance group <a href=\"../../avalanche/92-1506/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AVALANCHE</a>, who set out to destroy Shinra's Mako reactors with guerrilla strikes in an attempt to slow the Planet's decay. Although their first two bombing missions succeed, Cloud is separated from his companions by a Shinra trap and falls into the Sector 5 <a href=\"/shanty-town/3035-2305/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2305\">slums</a> located beneath a section of Midgar's upper plate. Here he meets a flower girl named <a href=\"/aerith-gainsborough/3005-784/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-784\">Aerith Gainsborough</a>, and after Cloud saves her from capture by the elite Shinra operatives known as <a href=\"/the-turks/3015-1182/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1182\">the Turks</a>, Aerith decides to accompany Cloud on his way back to AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7's slums. However, Shinra forces soon track down and eliminate most of the rebels by dropping an entire section of Midgar's upper plate onto Sector 7's slums, killing many innocent civilians in the process. Aerith is also abducted by Shinra during the attack. <a href=\"/president-shinra/3005-5018/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5018\">President Shinra</a> believes that Aerith possesses special powers as the last surviving <a href=\"/cetra/3015-1740/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1740\">Cetra</a>, and that she will help secure his company's future by leading Shinra to the mythical \"Promised Land,\" allegedly a source of boundless Mako energy.</p><p>Surviving AVALANCHE members <a href=\"../../tifa-lockhart/94-803/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tifa Lockhart</a> and <a href=\"../../barret-wallace/94-795/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barret Wallace</a> join Cloud as he climbs up Midgar's supports to reach the towering Shinra Building at the city's center, where Aerith is being held as a test subject by the twisted <a href=\"/professor-hojo/3005-2652/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2652\">Professor Hojo</a>. After infiltrating Shinra headquarters and rescuing Aerith (as well as <a href=\"/red-xiii/3005-822/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-822\">Red XIII</a>, another test subject), Cloud reaches the top floor and discovers President Shinra's corpse with a long <a href=\"/katana/3055-690/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-690\">katana</a> embedded in his back. He recognizes the sword as belonging to <a href=\"../../sephiroth/94-511/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sephiroth</a>, Cloud's former commander in SOLDIER, despite the fact that Sephiroth himself was declared \"missing in action\" and presumed dead after suddenly going rogue and razing Cloud's hometown of <a href=\"/nibelheim/3035-100/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-100\">Nibelheim</a> during a mission five years earlier. Escaping from the Shinra Building, Cloud's party leaves Midgar and chases after Sephiroth in order to prevent him from reaching the so-called Promised Land, as well as to take vengeance for Nibelheim's destruction.</p><p>As Cloud and company pursue Sephiroth across the Planet, they eventually learn that Lifestream is not only the source of all life, but also acts as a sort of planetary immune system. When their world is severely \"injured\" by a cataclysmic event, an abundance of Lifestream energy coalesces around the injury to \"heal\" the Planet. It is revealed that Sephiroth plans to cause just such a catastrophe by summoning <a href=\"../../meteor/93-1142/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meteor</a> to crash into the Planet, allowing him to absorb the enormous amount of Lifestream energy gathered at the point of impact and gain the powers of a <a href=\"/gods/3015-1047/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1047\">god</a>. Sephiroth also brings to light a series of unsettling revelations about Cloud's past, causing Cloud to question his own memories and even his identity as an individual.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Although the game's audiovisual presentation is significantly updated, Final Fantasy VII hews fairly close to its role-playing precursors in terms of core gameplay. Players explore a large world with their party of one or more <a href=\"/player-character/3015-968/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-968\">playable characters</a>, fighting enemies in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based</a> battles (many of which occur via <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">random encounters</a>) and interacting with <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs</a> via text-based dialogue. However, unlike its <a href=\"/2d/3015-1427/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\">2D</a> predecessors in the same series, Final Fantasy VII is not strictly limited to an overhead perspective while exploring environments such as <a href=\"/town/3035-1244/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1244\">towns</a> or <a href=\"/dungeon/3035-1131/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1131\">dungeons</a>, and often uses different <a href=\"/fixed-camera/3015-1715/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1715\">fixed camera</a> angles in the <a href=\"/pre-rendered-backgrounds/3015-1804/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1804\">prerendered backgrounds</a> that make up these areas. The game's discrete locales are connected by a fully-3D <a href=\"/world-map/3015-611/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">world map</a>, and the <a href=\"/battle-screen/3015-1762/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1762\">battle screen</a> is also rendered with full <a href=\"/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">polygonal</a> graphics.</p><p>Combat employs an updated form of the same <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">Active Time Battle</a> system first introduced in <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a>. By default, enemies will continue to attack regardless of whether any commands have been issued to <a href=\"/party-system/3015-125/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-125\">party</a> characters, requiring players to act quickly in executing their battle strategies. The maximum party size for Final Fantasy VII is limited to three characters, with main protagonist Cloud typically locked-in as a mandatory party member.</p><h3>Materia System</h3><p>One of Final Fantasy VII's most notable new gameplay features is the <a href=\"/materia/3055-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-27\">Materia</a> system. Throughout the game, the player's party can collect spheres of crystallized <a href=\"/mako/3015-1241/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1241\">Mako</a> called \"Materia\" containing the essence of <a href=\"/magic/3015-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-98\">magic</a>, with a total of eighty-three different varieties of Materia in all. Most of the game's equippable weapons and armor feature slots into which Materia can be inserted, granting the wearer powerful spells or other special abilities. Just as in previous Final Fantasy titles, using spells and certain abilities in battle also requires <a href=\"/mp/3015-762/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-762\">MP</a>.</p><p>By wearing equipped Materia into battle, it can gain Ability Points (or \"AP\") and <a href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">level-up</a> just like a playable character, potentially unlocking new and stronger abilities. Once a single piece of Materia reaches its <a href=\"/level-cap/3015-3025/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3025\">maximum level</a>, it is \"Mastered\" and produces a <a href=\"/clone/3015-284/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-284\">copy</a> of itself, which can be equipped and leveled-up in the same way. Certain pieces of equipment feature double or even triple \"growth rates\" for AP, allowing the wielder to level-up equipped Materia more quickly. Conversely, equipment with zero growth rates or even a total lack Materia slots can also be found.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207910\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207910\"><img alt=\"Cloud using \"Ice2\" magic in combat\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3689/207910-ffvii_7__before.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Cloud using \"Ice2\" magic in combat</figcaption></figure><p>Some equipment features pairs of \"linked\" Materia slots, which can allow compatible types of Materia to be paired together for increased effectiveness. For example, pairing a \"Lightning\" Materia with an \"All\" Materia allows the wearer to strike all enemies simultaneously with the elemental \"Bolt\" spell in a single turn. Certain advanced combinations of Materia can also be used by linking multiple copies of the same Materia (both equipped on the same character) to other compatible Materia types, often to devastating effect. For example, if a character pairs a \"Lightning\" Materia with \"All\" and a second copy of \"Lightning\" with \"HP Absorb,\" they will be able to cast \"Bolt\" on all foes while simultaneously regaining <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">HP</a> based on a percentage of the total damage inflicted.</p><p>There are five different color-coded categories of usable Materia in Final Fantasy VII: <strong>Magic</strong> (green), <strong>Command</strong> (yellow), <strong>Summon</strong> (red), <strong>Support</strong> (blue) and <strong>Independent</strong> (purple).</p><h4>Magic Materia</h4><p>Green-colored Materia allows the wielder to cast magic, including <a href=\"/white-magic/3015-1613/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1613\">healing</a>, damage-dealing or <a href=\"/status-effects/3015-671/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-671\">status</a>-inducing spells. With the exception of \"Master Magic,\" equipping Magic Materia also affects the wearer's <a href=\"/attributes/3015-1681/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">attributes</a>, typically lowering physically-oriented stats such as Strength and HP while boosting Magic and MP.</p><p>Several varieties of Magic Materia have associated elemental or status-effect properties, which can be only be utilized when the Materia is paired with either the \"Elemental\" or \"Added Effect\" Support Materia. While active on a weapon, these properties can add Elemental damage types to standard Attacks or gain a chance to inflict status effects; conversely, their presence on armor increases the wearer's resistance to the paired Elemental damage type or grants immunity to the paired status effect.</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Materia</th><th scope=\"col\">Spells</th><th scope=\"col\">Stat Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Barrier</td><td><ul><li><strong>Barrier</strong> (Lv.1): Sets Barrier status on one target (16 MP)</li><li><strong>MBarrier</strong> (Lv.2/5,000AP): Sets MBarrier status on one target (24 MP)</li><li><strong>Reflect</strong> (Lv.3/15,000AP): Sets Reflect status on one target (30 MP)</li><li><strong>Wall</strong> (Lv.4/30,000AP): Sets Barrier and MBarrier status on one target (58 MP)</li><li><strong>[Master]</strong> (Lv.5/45,000AP)</li></ul></td><td><p>MaxHP-5%<br />Str -2<br />Vit -1<br />MaxMP+5%<br />Mag +2<br />Spr +1</p></td></tr><tr><td>Comet</td><td><ul><li><strong>Comet</strong> (Lv.1): 5x base non-elemental attack to one target (70 MP)</li><li><strong>Comet2</strong> (Lv.2/12,000AP): 1.875x base non-elemental attack to four random targets (110 MP)</li><li><strong>[Master]</strong> (Lv.3/60,000AP)</li></ul></td><td><p>MaxHP-5%<br />Str -2<br />Vit -1<br />MaxMP+5%<br />Mag +2<br />Spr +1</p></td></tr><tr><td>Contain</td><td><ul><li><strong>Freeze</strong> (Lv.1): 5.9375x base Ice-elemental attack, ~68% chance to inflict Stop (82 MP)</li><li><strong>Break</strong> (Lv.2/5,000AP): 6.25x base Earth-elemental attack, ~32% chance to inflict Petrify (86 MP)</li><li><strong>Tornado</strong> (Lv.3/10,000AP): 6.5625x base Wind-elemental attack, ~32% chance to inflict Confusion (90 MP)</li><li><strong>Flare</strong> (Lv.4/15,000AP): 7.1875x base Fire-elemental attack (100 MP)</li><li><strong>[Master]</strong> (Lv.5/60,000AP)</li></ul><p>Added Effect: Stop, Petrify, Confusion<br /><em>*Note</em>: Incompatible with \"All\" Materia</p></td><td><p>MaxHP-10%<br />Str -4<br />Vit -2<br />MaxMP+10%<br />Mag +4<br />Spr +2</p></td></tr><tr><td>Destruct</td><td><ul><li><strong>DeBarrier</strong> (Lv.1): Removes Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect and Shield from one target (12 MP)</li><li><strong>DeSpell</strong> (Lv.2/5,000AP): Removes Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect, Shield, Haste, Slow, Stop, Regen, Death Force and Resist from one target (30 MP)</li><li><strong>Death</strong> (Lv.3/15,000AP): ~44% chance to inflict Death on one target;

While active on a weapon, these properties can add Elemental damage types to standard Attacks or gain a chance to inflict status effects; conversely, their presence on armor increases the wearer's resistance to the paired Elemental damage type or grants immunity to the paired status effect.</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Materia</th><th scope=\"col\">Level/AP</th><th scope=\"col\">Spells</th><th scope=\"col\">Stat Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"/alexander/3005-2885/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2885\">Alexander</a></td><td><p>Lv.2/25,000<br />Lv.3/65,000<br />Lv.4/100,000<br />Lv.5/150,000</p></td><td><ul><li><strong>Judgement</strong>: 7.5x base Holy-elemental damage (120 MP)</li></ul><p>Elemental: Holy</p></td><td><p>MaxHP-5%<br />MaxMP+5%<br />Mag +1<br />Spr +1</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/bahamut/3005-1744/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1744\">Bahamut</a></td><td><p>Lv.2/35,000<br />Lv.3/50,000<br />Lv.4/80,000<br />Lv.5/120,000</p></td><td><ul><li><strong>Mega Flare</strong>: 4.0625x base non-elemental barrier-piercing damage (100 MP)</li></ul></td><td>MaxHP-5% <p>MaxMP+5%<br />Mag +2<br />Spr +1</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/bahamut/3005-1744/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1744\">Bahamut ZERO</a></td><td><p>Lv.2/35,000<br />Lv.3/120,000<br />Lv.4/150,000<br />Lv.5/250,000</p></td><td><ul><li><strong>Tera Flare</strong>: 7.5x base non-elemental barrier-piercing damage (180 MP)</li></ul></td><td><p>MaxHP-10%<br />MaxMP+15%<br />Mag +4<br />Spr +4</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/chocobo/3015-259/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-259\">Choco</a>/ <a href=\"/moogles/3015-497/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-497\">Mog</a></td><td><p>Lv.2/2,000<br />Lv.3/14,000<br />Lv.4/25,000<br />Lv.5/35,000</p></td><td><ul><li><strong>DeathBlow!!</strong>: 1x base non-elemental damage, ~40% chance to inflict Stop (14 MP)</li><li><strong>Fat Chocobo</strong>: 1.25x base non-elemental damage (14 MP)</li></ul><p><em>*Note:</em> Summon uses one of two abilities;

When Sephiroth found out he was a creation of Shinra, he lost his mind. He assumed himself to be an Ancient as Jenova was his actual mother.

On the planet the Cetra, i.e. the ancients, were inhabiting at the time, Jenova used its abilities to trick the Cetra, killing them off one by one. In a desperate struggle, the remaining Cetra used all their power and locked away the life form in the Northern Crater (which was created when Jenova landed there in the first place). In the present day Jenova was rediscovered by Professor Gast and mistook as a Cetra. He used the Jenova life form in a project called 'The Jenova Project' where Jenova Cells were infused inside Lucrecia's womb. This is when Sephiroth was born.

The game was originally planned as a 2D game on the SNES, that was not the only major change to how the game eventually turned out. The Creator of Final Fantasy, <a href=\"../../hironobu-sakaguchi/72-633/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> originally intended for the game to take place in present day New York City. Development on the game was stalled, due to priority going over to the <a href=\"../../chrono-trigger/61-9249/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chrono Trigger</a> project that was being developed at the same time.</p><p>Development recommenced later on in 1995. The original script saw a major overview, with a detective story theme being cast aside and co-director, <a href=\"../../yoshinori-kitase/72-634/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoshinori Kitase</a>, pushed for the game to go 3D for concerns that the series would be left behind back in the 2D era. Also, it was decided to make the game for Nintendo’s next console, the N64. Though due to FFVII’s ambitious design, Square expressed concerns to Nintendo over their decision to use cartridges instead of a new format capable of storing much more information, called CD-ROM’s, on their new console. This dispute continued and led to Square announcing on the 12 of January 1996, that it would be dropping relations with Nintendo and developing FFVII on Sony’s debut console, the Playstation. A reported $45,000,000 was spent over the extent of the games development.</p><p>Development required the efforts of approximately 120 artists and programmers, using PowerAnimator and Softimage 3D software.

On June 3rd 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released for the European and American PSN stores for €9.99 and $9.99 respectively. This announcement was made days before during Sony's press conference of E3 2009. June 4th Marked the release of FF7 on the UK PSN store for the price of £7.99.</p><h2>PC Releases and Requirements</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII was published for Windows 95 by Eidos not long after the original Playstation release, in June of 1998, coming on multiple CDs like its console counterpart did. This version was largely intact in comparison to the console release, with a few differences:</p><ul><li>Polygonal graphics were smoother, employing texture filtering and taking advantage of the PC's higher resolution, with a 3D accelerator.</li><li>Pre-rendered graphics appeared grainier due to the low resolution of the renders juxtaposed with higher native resolution of computer monitors.</li><li>Soundtrack was output in MIDI format; quality of orchestration was thus dependent on the PC's sound card (a hack was later made available to import the Playstation sound file library such that the music was rendered to sound exactly how it did on consoles).</li><li>Localization was cleaned up, removing the poor grammar, missing words, and misspellings of the original console release.</li><li>Game's aesthetics were moddable, thanks to homebrew hacks, such that different character models, combat areas and sound themes could be applied providing for a more modern look and feel.</li></ul><p>Square Enix then re-released this PC version in August of 2012, exclusively from its online store as a digital download. The differences between console version and initial PC release apply with this re-release as well; in other words, backgrounds are still low-res and music is still MIDI. With this re-release, the following further changes apply:</p><ul><li>36 achievements are integrated into the game.</li><li>Character booster gives players the option to increase their character stats and money without restriction should they desire to just play through the plot (i.e. cheat through the game).</li><li>Support for cloud saves.</li><li>The game is no longer moddable natively and must undergo a total conversion process to the \"old\" version of the game in order to be modded (doing this removes the achievements, character booster, and cloud saves).</li></ul><p><b>Original Windows requirements (1998)</b></p><ul><li>Windows 95 with DirectX 5.1 installed;</li><li>Pentium 166 (without 3D accelerator card), Pentium 133 (with 3D accelerator card);</li><li>260MB Hard drive space (standard install), 460MB (maximum install);</li><li>32MB RAM;</li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible SVGA video card;</li><li>100% Windows 95 compatible 4x CD-ROM drive;</li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible sound card configured to playback digital and MIDI audio.</li></ul><p><b>Re-release Windows Requirements (2012)</b></p><ul><li>Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7 (32/64-bit)</li><li>At least 2GHz CPU</li><li>At least 1GB RAM</li><li>DirectX 9-compatible GPU</li></ul><h2>iOS Release</h2><p>An iOS port of Final Fantasy VII was released on August 20, 2015. It requires an iPhone 5S, iPad 3, or iPad Mini 2 running at least iOS 8.0 with 4GB of free space. Aside from control optimisation for touch devices, the iOS release also includes a maximum stats setting and the ability to disable all non-scripted combat encounters. Using these two features together allows players to experience the story without level grinding and frequent encounters.</p><h2>Remake</h2><p>Final Fantasy VII is a popular game in the series, and due to this rumours of a remake to the next generation consoles was imminent. In 2005 at the Sony E3 Press Conference, <a href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square-Enix</a> showed of a tech demo showing the opening intro sequence of the game on the PS3. Due to this a lot of buzz was being created around the subject, and individuals were getting excited at the notion of a remake.</p><p>Soon after Square-Enix made an official statement clearly stating that there are no plans for a remake to hit the stores any time soon. There has been even more speculation from the game <a href=\"/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii/3030-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2361\">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</a> that was released late 2007, which depicted the characters <a href=\"/zack-fair/3005-776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-776\">Zack</a> and <a href=\"/cloud-strife/3005-321/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-321\">Cloud</a> in CG scenes towards the end of the game. To add to this, during the end credits it stated 'To be continued in FINAL FANTASY VII'.</p><p>The remake was confirmed at the 2015 Square-Enix E3 press conference. It's going to be released on Xbox One and PS4.</p><h2>Related Media</h2><p>Due to the popularity of the original Final Fantasy VII game released in 1997, Square Enix have released other forms of media based of the world the original game was set in, using the same characters and places as reference points. First of which is the movie Advent Children released in 2006, which was a CGI film based years after the events of the original game. Next was the game <a href=\"/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii/3030-5571/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5571\">Dirge of Cerberus</a> released in 2006 on the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2</a>, which describes the story of optional character <a href=\"/vincent-valentine/3005-788/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-788\">Vincent Valentine</a>. It takes place before Advent Children and describes his relationship with Lucrecia Crescent (Sephiroth's mother) in detail. Next was the game <a href=\"/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii/3030-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2361\">Crisis Core</a> released in 2007 for the Playstation Portable. It takes place before the original Final Fantasy VII, with the main protagonist being Zack Fair. Zack had a intimate relationship with Aerith Gainsborough and was best friends with Cloud. It shows the story of his struggle and also how Cloud ended up in Midgar for the start of Final Fantasy VII. Relating to the game Crisis Core, there also was a OVA (original video animation) of the stories of Zack and Cloud, and how they managed to end up in Midgar. It is a 25 minute video which basically shows the ending the Crisis Core in anime form. The ending for Crisis Core was different from the Last Order OVA which was released first.</p>",

When his Pilot mentor is mortally wounded, he is given control of his mentor's Pilot kit and assigned Vanguard-class Titan, BT-7274, and must complete his mentor's mission.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like the previous game, Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter with a focus on calling down large mech suits called \"Titans\". Players can jump into these suits for direct control or allow them to fight on their own, under AI control. Unlike the previous game, titans no longer have full, recharging shields by default, so any damage done to them in multiplayer is permanent. Batteries can be found on enemy titans or other positions on the map. Bringing these to a titan grants them an overshield.</p><h2>Titans</h2><h3>Ion</h3><ul><li><strong>Chassis:</strong> Atlas-grade (Medium)</li><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> Splitter Rifle</li><li><strong>Offensive Ability:</strong> Laser Shot - A high powered, pinpoint accurate, shoulder mounted laser shot.</li><li><strong>Defensive Ability:</strong> Vortex Shield - Absorbs missiles and bullets which can be thrown back at enemies.</li><li><strong>Tactical Ability:</strong> Trip Wire - Throws out three mines held together with a laser beam, detonates when the beam is broken.</li><li><strong>Core Ability:</strong> Laser Core - High powered, oversized laser beam that lasts for a period of time.</li></ul><h4>Kits</h4><ul><li>Entangled Energy - Critical hits with the Splitter Rifle restore energy.

Along with the six loadouts above, BT can also equip two campaign-specific loadouts (one of which, Expedition, is given at the start of the game).</p><h4>Expedition</h4><ul><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> XD-16</li><li><strong>Offensive Ability:</strong> Multi-Target Missile System</li><li><strong>Defensive Ability:</strong> Vortex Shield</li><li><strong>Tactical Ability:</strong> Electric Smoke</li><li><strong>Core Ability:</strong> Burst Core</li></ul><h4>Brute</h4><ul><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> Quad Rocket</li><li><strong>Offensive Ability:</strong> Multi-Target Missile System</li><li><strong>Defensive Ability:</strong> Vortex Shield</li><li><strong>Tactical Ability:</strong> VTOL Hover</li><li><strong>Core Ability:</strong> Flight Core</li></ul><h2>Pilots</h2><h4>Tactical Abilities</h4><p>There are several pilot tactical abilities used in multiplayer. Only one ability can be used at a time and each ability provides a different appearance to the players character model. Abilities have cooldown periods and some allow for two charges to be used in quick succession.</p><ul><li>A-Wall - A wall which protects the pilot while standing behind it and also allows them to shoot through. Projectiles shot through the wall will have their damage amplified.</li><li><p>Cloak - The pilot becomes nearly invisible for a short duration or until they attack. Other pilots will be able to see a faint shimmer outline of the invisible pilot but Titans cannot see them at all.</p></li><li>Grapple - The pilot throws a grappling hook at their target. Can be used to rodeo Titans quickly, as a way to escape or to pull towards an enemy pilot for a melee kill.</li><li><p>Holo-Pilot - The pilot sends out holographic projections of themselves. These projections will mimic the actions of the pilot at the time of use.</p></li><li>Phase Shift - The pilot will shift into another reality for a brief period of time. No damage can be taken while in this other reality and no other pilots will be encountered while in it.</li><li>Pulse Blade - The pilot throws out a blade to a target location which acts as a sonar. It will highlight enemy forces in the area both on the minimap and through walls for its duration.</li><li>Stim - The pilot gains increased movement speed and health regeneration for the duration of the stim.</li></ul><h4>Boost Abilities</h4><p>In addition to the pilot tactical abilities, every player can select a boost ability to use throughout matches. Boost abilities have an activation cost based on the Titanfall gauge, which is filled by killing AI, stealing batteries, harming enemy titans, killing enemy pilots, etc. Multiple boost charges can be built up by reaching the activation cost over and over. Using a boost does not decrease the Titanfall gauge.</p><ul><li>Amped Weapons - Increased damage of all pilot weapons. Requires 80% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Battery Back-up - Immediately gain a battery. Requires 80% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Dice Roll - Randomly picks one other boost ability. Requires 36% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Hard Cover - Provides a one way wall which provides cover and allows the pilot to shoot through. Requires 20% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Holo-Pilot - Similar to the Pilot Tactical ability but sends out 3 holo-pilots instead of 1. Requires 40% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Map Hack - Reveals the location of all enemies on the radar and through walls for the pilots team. Requires 70% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Phase Rewind - Returns the player to a previous location. Requires 25% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Pilot Sentry - Sentry that targets enemy infantry and players. Requires 72% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Radar Jammer - Blocks the enemy teams radar. Requires 40% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Smart Pistol - Replacement secondary weapon, automatically locks on to enemy players and infantry. Has limited ammunition. Requires 60% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Ticks - Automated land mines that move around searching out enemy pilots and detonating when in proximity to one. Requires 65% on Titanfall gauge.</li><li>Titan Sentry - Similar to Pilot Sentry but targets enemy titans instead. Requires 35% on Titanfall gauge.</li></ul><h4>Pilot Kit Options</h4><p>In addition to a pilot ability and a boost ability players can further customize their pilot by picking two kit options. These options are divided into two categories with four options each. One option from each kit must be used by the pilot. Having two options that are listed under the same category is prohibited.</p><p>First Kit Options</p><ul><li>Fast Regen - Regenerate health sooner after taking damage.</li><li>Ordnance Expert - Faster cooldown on grenades and allows the pilot to see the arc the grenade will take.</li><li>Phase Embark - Teleport the pilot into their titan. Quicker than manually climbing in.</li><li>Power Cell - Faster cooldown on tactical ability.</li></ul><p>Second Kit Options</p><ul><li>Hover - Aiming while in the air allows the pilot to hover in mid-air.</li><li>Kill Report - Enemy deaths are shown through walls on the HUD.</li><li>Low Profile - Delays the warning shown to titans that they are being rodeo'd. Stops the pilot showing jet trails when jumping.</li><li>Wall Hang - Aiming while wall running allows the pilot to stay stationary on the wall.</li></ul><h4>Ordnance Options</h4><p>There are several grenade options available. All options can be \"cooked\" to explode sooner with the exception of the Satchel Charge. All grenades will instantly kill a pilot if the grenade is thrown directly at the pilot. Similarly they will deal a large amount of damage to titans if the weak-spot of a titan is hit.</p><ul><li>Arc Grenade - Stuns enemy pilots and titans.</li><li>Electric Smoke Grenade - Creates a cloud of electrical smoke that will damage enemy pilots and titans.</li><li>Firestar - Creates a small fire area of effect that will cause damage to any enemies that enter.</li><li>Frag Grenade - Explodes dealing damage to a large area.</li><li>Gravity Star - Creates a gravity well that sucks in enemies and causes bullets to curve around it.</li><li>Satchel Charge - Can be thrown and then remotely detonated.</li></ul><h4>Pilot Primary Weapons &amp; Options</h4><ul><li>Assault Rifles <ul><li>G2A5 - Semi-auto.</li><li>Hemlock BF-R - Burst fire.</li><li>R-201 Carbine - Full-auto.</li><li>V-47 Flatline - Full-auto.</li></ul></li><li>Grenadiers <ul><li>EM-4 Cold War - Burst fire.</li><li>EPG-1 - Energy based projectile.</li><li>R-6P Softball - Fires sticky grenades.</li><li>Sidewinder SMR - Full-auto.</li></ul></li><li>Light Machine Guns <ul><li>L-STAR - High rate of fire.</li><li>Spitfire - Medium rate of fire.</li><li>X-55 Devotion - Rate of fire increases over time.</li></ul></li><li>Shotguns <ul><li>EVA-8 Shotgun - Semi-auto.</li><li>Mastiff - Semi-auto.</li></ul></li><li>Sniper Rifles <ul><li>D-2 Double Take - Fires from two barrels.</li><li>Kraber-AP Sniper - Bolt-action.

The charm also introduced people to the \"Pandemonium Event\". This event is difficult to trigger owing to the requirement of specific items needed for its completion. First off you will need three <a href=\"/key/3055-105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-105\">keys</a> dropped from various <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">mini bosses</a> throughout the game. Once you have the three different keys you can transmute these in your horadric cube to open a portal in Act 5's town. This will trigger a hard event with a boss. This boss will drop one of the three organs you will need (<a href=\"/diablo/3005-849/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-849\">Diablo's</a> Horn, <a href=\"/baal/3005-1349/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1349\">Baal's</a> Eye and <a href=\"/mephisto/3005-1731/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1731\">Mephisto's</a> Brain) to trigger access to a zone called \"Uber Tristram\". Uber Tristram was intended only for the strongest players, since it pitted players against all the hardest bosses in the game at once, now in \"Uber\" form: Uber Diablo, Uber Baal and Uber Mephisto. Not only that but you will also have spawning minions around you. If you can take all of the bosses you will get this unique charm.

Jewels differ from other socketables because, unlike gems and runes which have set bonuses depending on where they are socketed (A topaz will always add lightning damage if socketed inside a weapon, for example), the modifiers on jewels are random. Magical jewels can have up to 2 modifiers and rare ones can have up to 4. Their modifiers are random.</p><h3>Crafted Items</h3><p>Crafted items are created by combining the right recipes in the <a href=\"/horadric-cube/3055-1887/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1887\">Horadric Cube</a> in order to create a predefined, random item. Crafted items have 3-4 predetermined stats with a few random ones mixed in. Everything from rings and armor to weapons, shields and amulets can be crafted and to great effect.

They would do this automatically by fighting by your side. Experience is shared between you and your mercenary - they gain more experience for their own kills. Mercenaries are persistent (unless killed), meaning they will come with you from game to game regardless of whether you leave the game. If slain, they can be resurrected in any one of the five towns. You can also equip items to the mercenary. Each mercenary can equip a helm, armor and a weapon; which weapons they can wield are limited by which mercenary particular you have working by your side.

The patch was delayed due to an exploit experienced in Blizzard's sister title, <a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">WarCraft 3</a> in which custom maps can be loaded with malware and distributed via a custom map. The Diablo \"legacy\" team had to swap out from working on 1.13 and help fix this major exploit. This has caused an uproar in the Diablo II community because a ladder reset was announced for before the 1.13 patch was to be released. Blizzard made the announcement because the patch was \"imminent\" but they were blind-sided by the WarCraft 3 issue.</p><p>The new 1.13 patch was to hit the Public Testing Realm in July 2009 according to a post made by Bashiok, a community manager for Blizzard. The patch was to include an increase in stash size and other changes as suggested by players on the official Diablo 2 forums.</p><p>This patch is now live on public testing realms awaiting further testing. Anyone can access this test server to try out the additions and changes. The increased stash size had to be removed as it threatened to undo the very game itself if they added an increased stash size. The game has however gained the ability to respec characters as well as some new bonus content and a few tweaks and balances.</p><p>The new 1.13 patch has now gone live. As of March 23rd, 2010 the Ladder has now been reset, sending all Ladder characters from before the patch to non-Ladder status.</p><h2>Patch 1.13</h2><p>Here are the changes introduced by the new patch:</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719131\" style=\"width: 316px\" data-ratio=\"0.73417721518987\" data-width=\"316\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719131\"><img alt=\"The Token of Absolution allows players to respec\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" data-width=\"316\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg 316w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Token of Absolution allows players to respec\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg 316w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" data-width=\"316\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Token of Absolution allows players to respec</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A new mystery has been revealed</strong> within Diablo's bosses you will now have a chance to find essence which you can transmute in your cube to make a token which again you can use to respec your characters attributes and skills.

Yoshi, known for using their long <a href=\"/tongue-attack/3015-2867/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2867\">tongues</a> to snare and eat enemies, have become a fan-favorite among the series (giving them <a href=\"/yoshi/3025-686/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-686\">their own games and spin-offs</a>, most notably <a href=\"/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/3030-2866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2866\">this game's prequel</a>).</p><p>Special bundles of the SNES in 1994 included a compilation cartridge mixing Super Mario World with <a href=\"/super-mario-all-stars/3030-18529/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18529\">Super Mario All-Stars</a>. The only difference in this version is a new sprite set for Luigi. The original game was later ported to the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> on February 11, 2002 as <a href=\"/super-mario-world-super-mario-advance-2/3030-7551/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7551\">Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2</a>. Along with a special version of the original <a href=\"/mario-bros/3030-19726/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19726\">Mario Bros.</a>, the port includes a variety of differences, including Luigi as a selectable character (who now has unique features, such as his floating jump from <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7406\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>), new voice acting, and the ability to save anywhere. The jingle that plays when a life is lost is also changed in the GBA version, pitched up from the original. The original game was also digitally re-released in Nintendo's <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> platform for the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> (on February 5, 2007) and <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> (on April 26, 2013).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Super Mario World plays like a standard sidescrolling platformer (similar to the previous <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3025-1899/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1899\">Super Mario Bros.</a> games), where players must guide Mario or Luigi through over 75 stages, split into over seven unique areas (or \"Worlds\"). Each stage has a goal to reach, usually a giant moving goalpost (known as Giant Gates) at the rightmost part of the level (some levels have alternate hidden exits, reachable by finding and carrying a <a href=\"/key/3055-105/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-105\">key</a> into a keyhole).</p><h3>Yoshi</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384242\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13226/384242-mario_all_stars___super_mario_world___snes000.png\" data-ratio=\"0.93359375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13226/384242-mario_all_stars___super_mario_world___snes000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384242\"><img alt=\"Yoshi's first appearance\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13226/384242-mario_all_stars___super_mario_world___snes000.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13226/384242-mario_all_stars___super_mario_world___snes000.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Yoshi's first appearance</figcaption></figure><p>Mario can ride Yoshi in all stages of the game except for castles and fortresses, and can make Yoshi shoot out his long tongue to snare and eat enemies.</p><h3>Power-Ups</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1293396\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1293396-120px_smw_cape_mario_gliding.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.95833333333333\" data-width=\"120\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 120px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1293396-120px_smw_cape_mario_gliding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1293396\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" data-width=\"120\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1293396-120px_smw_cape_mario_gliding.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1293396-120px_smw_cape_mario_gliding.jpg 120w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1293396-120px_smw_cape_mario_gliding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79739/1293396-120px_smw_cape_mario_gliding.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" data-width=\"120\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Throughout each level (usually in special <a href=\"/floating-blocks/3055-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-152\">Blocks</a>), Mario and Luigi can find <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-ups</a> to give themselves special abilities:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\"><strong>Super Mushroom</strong></a> - Transforms into Super Mario/Luigi, giving them a taller stature while allowing them to get hit once without losing a life. They can also break some Blocks by hitting it from below and Spin Jump on Rotating Blocks to break them. This power-up glides across the ground before collected and can sometimes be found by running over special areas (like some bushes). All Yellow Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Running over checkpoint gates as regular Mario/Luigi automatically puts them in Super form.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\"><strong>Fire Flower</strong></a> - Transforms into Fire Mario/Luigi.

Performing a Spin Jump also throws fireballs on both sides of them. This power-up is usually stationary before collected. In the GBA remake, getting hit while in Fire form changes them into Super form (similar to <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>).</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/feather-cape/3055-525/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-525\"><strong>Cape Feather</strong></a> - Transforms into Cape Mario/Luigi.

In addition, making a running jump allows them to fly through the air (allowing them to sail with the cape by holding Up and Down on the joypad). This power-up floats left and right downward before collected. All Green Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Jumping on Super Koopas cause them to drop a Cape Feather.</li></ul><p>Somewhat similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, players can have the ability to store spare power-ups for use at a later time. If a player collects two of the same power-up (or if they collect a Super Mushroom while in Fire or Cape forms), it will be placed in the Reserve Box at the top of the <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">HUD</a>. Getting hit (or pressing the Select button in-game) causes the item to slowly descend from the Reserve Box. Also new to the game are Roulette Blocks, which can carry either of these power-ups (along with the Starman power-up below) and is chosen when the player hits the block.</p><p>In addition, Mario and Luigi can find two rare power-ups that do not permanently transform them, instead temporarily giving them a special ability:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/starman/3055-23/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-23\"><strong>Starman</strong></a> - Grants them <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invincibility</a>, allowing them to bump onto any enemies to defeat them. Unlike previous games, players can chain combos by bumping onto enemies in quick succession (giving them easier <a href=\"/extra-life/3015-1806/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1806\">extra lives</a>). Usually found in Roulette Blocks.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Power Balloon</strong> - Temporarily inflates them allowing them to hover in the air and gradually float upwards. Found in only four levels and is not necessary for normal game progression (only required for reaching secret exits).</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Worlds</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340228\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"580\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 580px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340228\"><img alt=\"Dinosaur Land.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/340228-166.jpg 580w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/340228-166.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14477/340228-166.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dinosaur Land.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/340228-166.jpg 580w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14477/340228-166.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14477/340228-166.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dinosaur Land.</figcaption></figure><p>There are over 75 levels in the game, each split into multiple areas (or \"Worlds\").

The player takes control of Mario and runs, jumps, swims, and flies through the games various stages in order to complete challenges and collect power stars. The game uses Peach's castle as a hub world; within the castle, there are paintings that transport Mario to various worlds that contain power stars. As the player collects more power stars, more regions of the castle become available with new paintings to explore. By ultimately collecting enough stars, the player is able to access the final level in which Bowser resides for the final showdown.</p><h3>Controls</h3><p>Mario's movements are controlled using the controller's analog stick. Gentle tilts of the stick cause Mario to move at a walking pace, while tilting further causes him to break into a run. Pressing the A Button allows Mario to jump, and for the first time in the Super Mario series, he can perform actions such as a wall jump, a jumping backflip, and a running triple jump.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171134\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171134\"><img alt=\"Mario performing a backflip.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mario performing a backflip.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171134-super_mario_64__u___snap0004.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario performing a backflip.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171137\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54545454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171137\"><img alt=\"Mario going for a swim.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg 550w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mario going for a swim.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg 550w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1171137-inset3_09_0213_friday13th.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mario going for a swim.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Walking</b> - Press the analog stick gently in the desired direction.</li><li><b>Running</b> - Press the analog stick all the way in the desired direction.</li><li><b>Wall Hug</b> - Hold the analog stick at the same angle as the wall to slide along it.</li><li><a href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\"><b>Jump</b></a> - Press A to jump.</li><li><a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\"><b>Double Jump</b></a> - Press A to jump and then again after returning to the ground to jump higher than the first jump.</li><li><a href=\"/triple-jump/3015-1565/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1565\"><b>Triple Jump</b></a> - Same as double jump but with a third jump added after returning to the ground.

The C Buttons on the N64 controller could nudge the camera to provide a better view of the action, while the C Up button zoomed the camera in to view the world from Mario's eyes.</p><p>Lakitu, a character commonly seen in the Super Mario series as one of Mario's enemies, has a new role in Super Mario 64 as the game's cameraman. At times when the player is viewing Mario's reflection in a mirrored surface, Lakitu can also be seen behind him, holding the camera if the viewing angle is right. This is justified in game with Lakitu being a reporter for a popular news station who's covering the Princess's kidnapping. A similar scenario would be presented years later in <a href=\"/mario-kart-8/3030-42929/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42929\">Mario Kart 8 </a>with various Toadstools covering the race events for a similar organization. </p><h2>Presentation</h2><p>As the first polygonal Super Mario title, Super Mario 64's graphics were a significant change from the sprite art of <a href=\"/super-mario-world/3030-1334/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1334\">Super Mario World</a>.

It is the longest and arguably hardest of the Bowser levels and at the top is a pipe that leads Mario to his final confrontation with the Koopa King. To defeat Bowser this time Mario must launch him into three bombs instead of just one. After Bowser is hit two times the land next to the bombs falls away leaving the arena in the shape of a star. This makes the last throw to kill Bowser more difficult as it must be done from farther away. When Bowser is destroyed, Mario is awarded with a giant star and Princess Peach is rescued.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Items</h2><p>Super Mario 64 excludes many of the franchise's classic items, such as the <a href=\"/super-mushroom/3055-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-49\">super mushroom</a> and <a href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\">fire flower</a>, in favor of special hats that give Mario unique abilities for a limited time. These caps include the metal cap that make him invulnerable and able to walk on the ocean floor, the vanish cap that allows him to pass through certain barriers, and the wing cap that lets him fly.</p><p>However, some classic Mario items do make a return. These include the <a href=\"/1-up/3055-77/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-77\">1-up mushroom</a>, <a href=\"/koopa-shell/3055-309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-309\">Koopa shell</a>, and collectible <a href=\"/coin/3055-219/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-219\">coins</a>, though the functions of coins and shells are different compared to previous Super Mario games. In Super Mario 64, Koopa shells are rare and can be used to surf across the ground and destroy enemies, while collecting coins can restore Mario's health gauge. There are also three types of coins, yellow, blue, and red, worth one, two, and five health points respectively. Additionally, each world contains eight red coins, and collecting all eight during one visit earns Mario a power star.</p><p>A unique attribute of the 1up Mushroom is that it will always follow and fly to the player after they trigger it.  This would spawn a minor youtube sensation years later where players would trigger a 1up Mushroom and then attempt to complete a challenge without being hit by it.</p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313288\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313288\"><img alt=\"Super Mario 64 CG artwork\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Super Mario 64 CG artwork\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12044/313288-superm24.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Mario 64 CG artwork</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> began work on a 3D iteration of the Mario franchise after working on <a href=\"/star-fox/3030-3984/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3984\">Star Fox</a> for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. For a time he considered developing it for the Super Nintendo, but later decided to develop it for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> due to the limitations of the SNES's hardware. The team spent many of the first months developing the camera and how the gameplay would work.</p><p>Originally the game levels were to be linear, but it was later decided that they should be open, free-roaming environments. However, the concept of linear levels can still be seen in final game in the <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> levels, which require Mario to traverse a set path of obstacles to reach Bowser's lair. The development team prioritized making Mario's movements feel fluid and natural.</p><p>Before any levels were created, they tested his movements in a simple grid level which featured a golden bunny named \"MIPS\". This character later made an appearance in the final game. When the levels were finally designed, they incorporated more <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles</a> than was typically associated with Mario games. This is probably because <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> was in development at the same time but was not released until years later. Some of its puzzle ideas were likely incorporated into Mario 64.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The soundtrack to Super Mario 64 was composed by renowned Nintendo composer <a href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-606\">Koji Kondo</a>. It was first published by <a href=\"/pony-canyon-inc/3010-926/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-926\">Pony Canyon</a> in Japan on July 19, 1996. It was later published in North America by Nintendo on November 1st, 1996.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224193\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"336\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 336px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224193\"><img alt=\"Super Mario 64 Original Soundtrack\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg 336w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Super Mario 64 Original Soundtrack\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70944/1224193-sm64ost.jpg 336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Mario 64 Original Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>It's a me, Mario!</li><li>Title Theme</li><li>Peach's Message</li><li>Opening</li><li>Super Mario 64 Main Theme</li><li>Slider</li><li>Inside the Castle Walls</li><li>Looping Steps</li><li>Dire, Dire Docks</li><li>Lethal Lava Land</li><li>Snow Mountain</li><li>Haunted House</li><li>Merry-Go-Round</li><li>Cave Dungeon</li><li>Pirahna Plant's Lullaby</li><li>Powerful Mario</li><li>Metallic Mario</li><li>File Select</li><li>Correct Solution</li><li>Toad's Message</li><li>Power Star</li><li>Race Fanfare</li><li>Star Catch Fanfare</li><li>Game Start</li><li>Course Clear</li><li>Game Over</li><li>Stage Boss</li><li>Koopa's Message</li><li>Koopa's Road</li><li>Koopa's Theme</li><li>Koopa Clear</li><li>Ultimate Koopa</li><li>Ultimate Koopa Clear</li><li>Ending Demo</li><li>Staff Roll</li><li>Pirahna Plant's Lullaby-Piano</li></ol><h2>Reception</h2><p>Super Mario 64 is one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful video games of all time.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Released on October 26, 2000, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is the follow-up to previous <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a> favorite <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. Majora's Mask features several technological upgrades over its predecessor, as well as new game mechanics, such as a time travel element which can be used to influence events in the game's non-linear structure. The game was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo.</p><p>Critical reception was almost unanimous in favor of the game, with many critics praising the game's darker story, the time travel element, its non-linearity, and the evolution of Ocarina of Time's gameplay systems. Fan reception was more mixed, as is typical with a major <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Zelda</a> release, with some fans complaining about the game's departure from the norm, as well as the reduced accessibility. In 2010, Majora's Mask was voted as \"Game of the Decade\" by users of <a href=\"https://www.gamefaqs.com/\">GameFAQs</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360356-guay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360356\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360356-guay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360356\"><img alt=\"Link \"Z targets\" an enemy.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/360356-guay.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360356-guay.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360356-guay.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/360356-guay.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Link \"Z targets\" an enemy.</figcaption></figure><p>The actual mechanics of controlling Link are identical to the mechanics in Ocarina of Time. <a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a> moves with the analog stick, can lock on to enemies with the Z button, and equip three items to the three C buttons. The core sword-fighting handles exactly the same as it was in Ocarina of Time, as is playing the <a href=\"/ocarina/3055-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-62\">Ocarina</a> and using items. However, unlike the previous installment, there is a much greater emphasis on time management, since Link is constantly on the clock. The game starts Link at 6:00 AM on the First Day (which can be observed on the new Clock icon at the bottom of the screen, displaying the time and the date) and the Moon will destroy <a href=\"/termina/3035-200/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-200\">Termina</a> at 6:00 AM on the Third Day.</p><p>Since the seventy-two game hours last approximately fifty-four minutes of real time, it seemed, at the outset, that the game had provided Link with an impossible task. However, upon completing the game's tutorial level (in which <a href=\"/deku/3015-856/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-856\">Deku</a> Link is confined to the city, allowing the player to see how the seventy-two hour cycle affected the game world) Link reclaims the Ocarina of Time. Playing the Song of Time on the Ocarina (identical to the version in Ocarina of Time) would warp Link back to the beginning of the First Day, starting again at 6:00 AM. By traveling back to the beginning of the First Day, the player has, effectively, an infinite amount of time to do everything needed in order to complete the game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/1034226-songoftime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1034226\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/1034226-songoftime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1034226\"><img alt=\"By playing the Song of Time, Link can return to the dawn of his first day in Termina.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5758/1034226-songoftime.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/1034226-songoftime.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5758/1034226-songoftime.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5758/1034226-songoftime.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>By playing the Song of Time, Link can return to the dawn of his first day in Termina.</figcaption></figure><p>More importantly, the passage of time can be slowed down significantly by playing the Inverted Song of Time, the notes of the Song of Time backwards. While this slows down the in-game passage of time, it does not slow down Link's <i>perception</i> of time, giving the player just over two and a half hours to complete tasks in a given cycle.</p><p>To create a game that utilizes the player's need to travel back in time every two and a half hours, the entire game is designed around \"scheduled events.\" Similar to the system used in <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, every single character in the game world operates on their own \"schedule.\" <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">Non-player characters</a> (NPCs) will appear in certain places only at certain times, and certain events can only be witnessed at certain times and at specific places. Link can learn the schedules of the various in-game characters by investigating them and (automatically) recording the information in his journal. The Journal can then be used to help Link meet up at specific locations to complete side missions, unlock the path to the next dungeon, or complete a dungeon altogether. Link can use this journal to be at the right place at the right time, allowing him to solve the puzzles necessary to move foreword, and complete NPC quests in order to earn items key to progressing in the game.</p><p>When the end of the Third Day draws near, Link can then warp back to the beginning of the First Day and continue on his journey through the same three days again. However, warping back to the start of the first day means that everything in the world moves back to the first day. All the puzzles solved to go to new areas are now again unsolved. The NPCs won't remember that Link solved their problems, because he hasn't done it yet. All the quests Link completed are no longer completed. Furthermore, once Link goes back in time, he loses all of the weapon ammunition he has collected (such as arrows and deku nuts) as well as all of the Rupees carried in his wallet and the small/ Big keys he obtained from the game's dungeons. Link will not, however, lose any masks, songs, sword upgrades, Rupees stored in the bank, or items obtained over the past three days.</p><p>This design setup, initially, seems maddening, but the game provides a few ways to mitigate the headache of repeating the same sections over and over again over seventy-two hours. First, Majora's Mask effectively splits game progression into three parts. To move forward in the game, the player must first go to the unique zone where the next objective is located. Next, the player has to find the entrance to the dungeon in the zone. Finally, the player has to complete the dungeon. Each of these steps can be completed in two-and-a-half hours and completing each of these steps rewards Link with a way to avoid repeating the puzzles/dungeon/traveling over and over again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360359\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360359\"><img alt=\"Heart Containers are one of several items which are spared the negative effects of time travel.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Heart Containers are one of several items which are spared the negative effects of time travel.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/360359-heartpiece20.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Heart Containers are one of several items which are spared the negative effects of time travel.</figcaption></figure><p>Completing the first two steps (going to the new area or finding the entrance to the dungeon) will usually put Link close to a warp point (in the form of an owl statue). By playing the Song of Soaring, Link can warp to any of these statues once having discovered them. Because songs and warp points don't disappear when Link travels back in time, the player can often times find the warp point, go back the beginning of the First Day, warp to the newly discovered point, and continue the game from there. This keeps the game’s time limit from being too unmanageable, as it simply encourages the player to play the game in chunks, completing one section, going back in time and moving onto the next section.</p><p>Defeating a dungeon's main boss will free one of four giants, protectors of Termina who are Clock Town's only hope in stopping the Moon. They must be summoned at the right moment by playing the Oath to Order, which Link learns after defeating the first boss. Thus, all the player has to do is complete each of the game's four dungeons to summon the giants to hold up the moon and stop <a href=\"/skull-kid/3005-739/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-739\">Skull Kid</a>, the game's primary antagonist.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-310810\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73319327731092\" data-width=\"476\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 476px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-310810\"><img alt=\"The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask, the antagonist of the game.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png 476w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask, the antagonist of the game.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png 476w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5758/310810-majmask1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask, the antagonist of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after defeating <a href=\"../../ganon/94-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganondorf</a> and saving <a href=\"../../hyrule/95-13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule</a> in Ocarina of Time, Link sets off on a new journey to reunite himself with \"a lost friend,\" implied to be <a href=\"/navi/3005-1176/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\">Navi the Fairy</a>. With <a href=\"/epona/3005-1968/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1968\">Epona</a> and the Ocarina of Time, Link travels to a mysterious forest when he encounters the Skull Kid. Armed with the great power of <a href=\"/majoras-mask/3055-1346/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1346\">Majora's Mask</a>, the Skull Kid steals the Ocarina of Time, scares Epona away, and magically turns Link into a <a href=\"/deku/3015-856/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-856\">Deku</a> <a href=\"/deku/3015-856/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-856\">Scrub</a>.

Inside, Link is greeted by the <a href=\"/happy-mask-salesman/3005-3776/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3776\">Happy Mask Salesman</a> from Ocarina of Time, from whom the Skull Kid stole Majora's Mask, claiming that it holds a terrible power. The Happy Mask Salesman tasks Link with recovering the mask within seventy-two hours, before, the Happy Mask Salesman claims, he must leave the town.</p><h3>The game begins:</h3><p>The central area is the bustling locale of <a href=\"/clock-town/3035-549/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-549\">Clock Town</a>, in the land of <a href=\"/termina/3035-200/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-200\">Termina</a> (a parallel world to Link's Hyrule). After stepping outside the Clock Tower, the Moon can be seen menacingly in the sky above. Using the power of the dark mask, Skull Kid has turned the Moon into a terrible monster which will crash into Termina in seventy-two hours, precisely three days from the moment Link exits the clock tower.</p><p>After the first cycle of three days, Link gets the Ocarina of Time back from the Skull Kid. He remembers the Song of Time and plays it as soon as he picks it up. This magically resets the three day cycle, when he first met the Happy Mask Salesman. Link and the Salesman seem to be the only ones who remember everything that happened in those three days. The Happy Mask Salesman sees the instrument in Link's hands and teaches him the Song of Healing, which returns him to his original form, transforming the curse into a Deku Mask that will allow him to become a Deku Scrub at will. In return, the Happy Mask Salesman once again asks that Link retrieve Majora's Mask. To do so, he must venture into the four regions surrounding Clock Town and acquire the masks worn by four evil monsters. Only then can he face the Skull Kid and retrieve the mask. Now, Link has to once again take up the sword, recover Epona, and find a way to defeat Skull Kid and stop him from destroying Termina.</p><h2><b>Masks</b></h2><h3>Transformation Masks</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2699300\" data-ratio=\"1.1887941534714\" data-width=\"1642\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1642px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2699300\"><img alt=\"Link's Deku Scrub transformation form.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-width=\"538\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 1642w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 1615w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 807w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 538w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link's Deku Scrub transformation form.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 1642w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 1615w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 807w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/71263/2699300-mm_deku_link.jpg 538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-width=\"538\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link's Deku Scrub transformation form.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of Majora's Mask, Link will acquire a variety of masks that can confer various abilities.

Wearing the Mask at any time (which can be equipped to the C buttons) will turn Link back into the Deku scrub, while taking it off returns Link to Human form. Along with the Deku Mask, Link can find a Goron Mask (turning Link into a Goron) and a Zora Mask (turning Link into a Zora). These transformation masks are the more important of the game's 24 masks, as the game requires Link to switch between the various forms (Human Link, Deku Link, Goron Link, and Zora Link) to complete puzzles and defeat Bosses.

Human Link can pull himself onto ledges, grab onto heights, and has the greatest maneuverability in combat. Deku Link is too short to grab ledges, and cannot swim in water (the form can hop across Water, but after five hops, Link falls into the water and drowns). Deku Link can use magic to fire a magical spitball at opponents to stun them, as well as to pop balloons in the air. Deku Link can also launch out of flower pads, and use large petals as propellers to float to a new location (giving Link a float after his jump for more Air Control. Goron Link is extremely heavy, very slow in normal combat, has a hard time pulling himself up ledges, and is damaged greatly by Water. The Goron Mask lets Link, however, curl into a ball and roll at opponents, even growing spikes to damage enemies and break boulders (much like <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>). Zora Link can breathe underwater and swim much faster than Human Link.

Each form creates a different instrument when the Ocarina is selected; Deku Link pulls out a large Organ and keyboard, Goron Link grabs a huge set of bongo drums, and Zora Link uses a marlin skeleton as a Guitar. In addition to these three masks, there are 21 other masks spread throughout the game. While many of the masks can be collected simply through normal game progression, many of the masks can only be earned by completing a certain NPC's quest (usually tied to that NPC's schedule, requiring Link to do something specific at a certain time). To collect the Fierce Deity Mask (the 24th and final Mask, which greatly increases Link's power and defense), the player will have to complete every sub quest in the game, which means collecting the other 23 masks. Like the weapons, songs and warp points, Masks aren’t lost when Link travels to the beginning of the \"First Day.\"</p><h3>Additional Masks</h3><table><thead><tr><th>All Night Mask</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1050727\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1050727\"><img alt=\"All Night Mask\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All Night Mask\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050727-allnightmask.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All Night Mask</figcaption></figure><ul><li>This mask has one use only: to listen to Anju's Grandmother's stories, which normally make Link fall asleep.</li><li>Listen to the first story (Carnival of Time) and choose all the top answers to receive a Piece of a Heart.</li><li>Listen to the second story (Four Giants) and choose \"I dunno\" to receive another Piece of a Heart.</li><li>To get it, on the First Night at 12:00 AM, Link has to stop Sakon the Thief from stealing the Bomb Bags from the Old Lady, or else those will be at the Curiosity Shop later.</li><li>Then, on the Final Night at 10:00 PM, Link can buy the All-Night Mask at the Curiosity Shop for 500 Rupees.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Bomb Mask</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1050728\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1050728\"><img alt=\"Bomb Mask\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bomb Mask\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9023/1050728-blastmask1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bomb Mask</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Wear this mask and press B to explode.

Part of the game's superior visual fidelity is due to the game's required use of the Nintendo 64 \"Expansion Pak.\" The expanded RAM capacity of the pak (8 MB instead of the initial 4MB inside the N64) allowed for more detailed character models than seen in Ocarina of Time, as well as higher resolution textures and less \"fog\" obscuring objects in the distance (meaning a longer draw distance). The pak also provided slight improvements to the game's frame rate, as well as superior lighting effects.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360362\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-360362\"><img alt=\"Dance the time away!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dance the time away!\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4253/360362-scarecrow.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dance the time away!</figcaption></figure><p>While the game looks better than its predecessor, Majora's Mask still retains the art design seen in Ocarina of Time. While many of the game's textures, locations, and effects are new, character models were lifted straight out of Ocarina of Time and only slightly changed for the new game. For instance, the <a href=\"/twinrova/3005-5559/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5559\">Twinrova</a> witches (the boss fight from Ocarina of Time's spirit temple) were potion sellers in Majora's Mask, and the <a href=\"/kakariko-village/3035-509/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-509\">Kakariko</a>/<a href=\"/hyrule-castle/3035-1765/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1765\">Hyrule Castle</a> soldiers now patrol the streets of Clock Town. Some of the character models aren't altered in the slightest from Ocarina of Time, but most of them have been upgraded. For example, Link looks distinctly different from the appearance of \"Young Link\" in Ocarina of Time.</p><h2>Majora's Mask 3D</h2><p>After years of subtle hints, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D was announced during a Nintendo Direct on November 5th, 2014. Majora's Mask 3D is a massively overhauled version of the<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43/\">Nintendo 64</a> cult classic <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/3030-13594/\">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> featuring not only significant visual upgrades but also gameplay and playability enhancements.</p><h3>Changes</h3><h4>Clock</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2717448\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2717448\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.png 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.png 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2717448-12+-+yd7ngfd.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>One of the most notable changes is the new design for the in-game clock. Gone is the elaborately ornamental clock of the original in favor of a very simplified time-bar showing the progress of time for the entire three-day span at once.</p><p>The current status indicator now also displays a symbol for the time of day along with the exact time as a digital clock.</p><h4>Menus</h4><p>The bottom screen serves as the main interface for menus, just like in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d/3030-31776/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31776\">Ocarina of Time 3D</a>. The inventory supports drag-and-drop for assigning items to buttons and the side of the screen is lined with touch-enabled shortcuts to other sub-menus and default items such as the Pictobox or the Ocarina of Time (or equivalent instrument during a transformation).</p><h4>Owl &amp; Feather Statues</h4><p>Playing the Song of Time and returning to the dawn of the first day no longer automatically saves the game. Saving is now handled exclusively via Feather Statues (called Quill Statues in the PAL version) and Owls Statues. Owls Statues still serve as warp points for fast travel, like in the original game. They also still double as save points, however their saves are now permanent, unlike the original where, once loaded, the save game made at an Owl Statue would be erased. New are Feather Statues that are placed all over Termina, enabling the same save functionality as the Owl Statues. These statues represent the only way to save in Majora's Mask 3D.</p><h4>Song of Double Time</h4><p>In the original N64 version, the Song of Double Time, which Link can optionally learn by following the Scarecrow's hints, allows him to skip ahead twelve hours into the future. Now, playing this song will allow players to skip ahead to any time in the future they like, in hourly increments. The three Song of Time variants are also displayed on the bottom screen's song list from the moment Link gets the Ocarina back.</p><h4>Bomber's Notebook</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2717451\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717451-02+-+njmona7.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717451-02+-+njmona7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2717451\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-width=\"533\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717451-02+-+njmona7.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717451-02+-+njmona7.png 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717451-02+-+njmona7.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2717451-02+-+njmona7.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" data-width=\"533\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The functionality of this book, given to Link now by the Happy Mask Salesman instead of Jim the Bomber, has been greatly enhanced in Majora's Mask 3D. The Bomber's Notebook now can be displayed across both the top and bottom screen, showing the familiar schedule table with clearer visual language and new additions that make it easier to keep track of events. The schedule now informs players of the current status of any side quest they are currently partaking in, as well as offering detailed event and character descriptions. Most notably, however, is the new ability to set an alarm for Tatl to remind the player at a desired time of an upcoming event in the schedule. The Bombers themselves now also have become more useful as they give out hints about events or things to discover which they originally did not do, despite them saying they're collecting info about the people in town.</p><h4>Sheikah Stones</h4><p>Just like Ocarina of Time 3D, Sheikah Stones are found in the game world that the player can choose to consult for tips and hint videos with useful information about progressing in the quest to save Termina from its fate.</p><h4>Fishing</h4><p>A completely new addition to this version of the game is the fan-favorite fishing mini-game, found in many other Zelda titles. Dedicated Fishing Holes can be found in Southern Swamp and The Great Bay. In these locations, Link is able to wear the Fierce Deity Mask freely but he is not allowed to leave with it.</p><h4>Transformation Abilities</h4><p>Zora Link moves slower and has to use magic to dive-jump out of the water. This brings his ability usage in line with those of Goron Link in terms of their application and limitations. Goron Link's roll is now controlled by pressing (A) once to initiate and then pressing it again to stop it, instead of just holding the button for the desired duration in the original version. The Goron Punch animation has also been sped-up.</p><h4>Redesigned Boss Fights</h4><p>All boss fights have been redone with new behavior patterns and elements in the fights themselves. This was to ensure players were able to become aware of the bosses actual weaknesses instead of just mindlessly whacking on them.</p><ul><li>Odolwa now is a more involved fight with different challenges during his phases.</li><li>Goht now has a Majora's Mask-eyeball on his back that can be hit with arrows or with the sword while he's stunned.</li><li>The fight against Gyorg has been altered with a completely different second phase. Players can now hurt Gyorg without being forced to stun him first.</li><li>The Twinmold boss fight has been significantly revamped, allowing for more interactivity and cutting down on players either having to wait around for a long time or simply overpowering the boss.</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3><ul><li>One of the fairies in Woodfall Temple is in a new location</li><li>The Great Fairy rewards in Woodfall Temple and Snowhead Mountain have been switched.</li><li>The bottle originally obtained from Dampe is now a Heart Piece.</li><li>Koume now grants Link a bottle for completing the Swamp Tour after clearing Woodfall Temple.</li><li>An additional seventh bottle can be obtained from Gorman on the Second Day.</li><li>The Pictograph Box can take full-color photographs now that are saved on the SD card.</li><li>Some characters in and outside of Clock Town appear in different locations.</li><li>Previously scrapped Ocarina transformation icons from the N64 version are now used to display the relevant instrument when wearing a transformation mask.</li><li>The game now offers three save slots in all versions. Originally, only the Japanese N64 version had three slots because that version did not have temporary Owl Statue saving which required dedicated memory in the Western releases with the Owl Statues.</li></ul><h3>New Nintendo 3DS</h3><p>Playing the game on a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/new-nintendo-3ds/3045-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-156\">New Nintendo 3DS</a> enables support of the C-Stick for full 360° camera control, which was not possible in the original version. This feature is also supported for users with a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/circle-pad-pro-support/3015-7175/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7175\">Circle Pad Pro</a> (XL) on a regular Nintendo 3DS model.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Alongside its announcement <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/satoru-iwata/3040-46955/\">Satoru Iwata</a> said that the development team was working to maintain the original version's difficulty, while simultaneously \"keeping the game accessible to anyone\". <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/eiji-aonuma/3040-38943/\">Eiji Aonuma</a> has stated that the game began development almost immediately after the completion of Ocarina of Time 3D, giving the game a development cycle of more than three years.</p><h3>Special Editions</h3><p>In addition to standard physical and digital releases, a special edition containing a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/majoras-mask/3055-1346/\">Majora's Mask</a> pin, steelbook, and double-sided poster is set to release exclusively in Europe and Australia. In North America, a Limited Edition featuring a copy of the game and a Skull Kid figurine will be released. Additionally, a special Majora's Mask-themed New Nintendo 3DS XL will be available on the game's release day in all regions. PAL regions and Japan will get a pre-installed copy of the game with the bundle while the North American version will just come with the game system and no copy of the game.</p><h3>Reception</h3><p>The new version of Majora's Mask was generally received very positively with many praising the many improvements to the gameplay while some criticized a few of the changes such as the altered swimming mechanics. The game has sold 2.03 million copies worldwide as of March 31, 2015. Additionally, Nintendo of America announced in early March 2015, that Majora's Mask 3D is the fastest selling handheld Zelda game ever with 515.000 copies sold in North America in its first month.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Disc 1 (59:40)</th><th>Disc 2 (59:05)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ol><li>Title Screen (2:13)</li><li>Forest Ambush (1:11)</li><li>Forest Chase (0:50)</li><li>Clock Tower Cavern (1:44)</li><li>Majora's Theme (1:32)</li><li>The Clock Tower (1:39)</li><li>Mask Salesman (0:53)</li><li>Clock Town Day 1 (1:29)</li><li>Fairy's Fountain (1:10)</li><li>Mayor Dotour (1:36)</li><li>Milk Bar Latte (1:26)</li><li>Guru-Guru's Song (1:16)</li><li>Clock Town Day 2 (1:07)</li><li>House (1:10)</li><li>Kamaro's Dance (0:45)</li><li>Store (1:14)</li><li>Sword Training (1:05)</li><li>Complete a Heart Piece (0:05)</li><li>Clock Town Day 3 (1:09)</li><li>Keaton (1:23)</li><li>Target Practice (1:13)</li><li>Rosa Sisters' Dance (1:07)</li><li>Mini Game (1:07)</li><li>Final Hours (2:08)</li><li>Astral Observatory (1:24)</li><li>Song of Time (1:41)</li><li>Ocarina Song of Time (0:13)</li><li>Ocarina Song of Healing (0:08)</li><li>Song of Healing (1:23)</li><li>New Song (0:12)</li><li>A New Mask (0:07)</li><li>Inverted Song of Time (0:11)</li><li>Song of Double Time (0:12)</li><li>Termina Field (1:31)</li><li>Gaebora's Theme (1:07)</li><li>Battle (1:36)</li><li>Game Over (0:10)</li><li>Open Chest (0:10)</li><li>Item Catch (0:06)</li><li>Small Item Catch (0:05)</li><li>Southern Swamp (1:44)</li><li>Kotake's Potion Shop (1:35)</li><li>Woods of Mystery (1:14)</li><li>Boat Tour (1:55)</li><li>Court of the Deku King (2:28)</li><li>Ocarina Sonata of Awakening (0:05)</li><li>Sonata of Awakening (0:25)</li><li>Ocarina Song of Soaring (0:05)</li><li>Song of Soaring (0:10)</li><li>Surfacing of Woodfall (0:06)</li><li>Woodfall Temple (1:20)</li><li>Mini Boss (2:07)</li><li>Woodfall Clear (0:19)</li><li>The Four Giants (1:40)</li><li>Ocarina Oath to Order (0:08)</li><li>Oath to Order (0:25)</li><li>Gorman Bros.
